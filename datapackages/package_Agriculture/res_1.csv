The economic types include farming, mining, manufacturing, services, Federal/State government, and unspecialized counties. The policy types include housing stress, low education, low employment, persistent poverty, population loss, nonmetro recreation, and retirement destination.

The most recent RUCA codes are based on data from the 2000 decennial census. The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.
 
The 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes.

The database includes information on State-level SNAP policies relating to eligibility criteria, recertification and reporting requirements, benefit issuance methods, availability of online applications, use of biometric technology (such as fingerprinting), and coordination with other low-income assistance programs. Data are provided for all 50 States and the District of Columbia for each month from January 1996 through December 2011.
 
The information in this database can facilitate research on factors that influence SNAP participation and on SNAP's effects on a variety of outcomes, such as health and dietary intake. More specifically, the database can be used to:

- Describe the differences in the State-level administration of SNAP and trends in the adoption of specific State-level SNAP policies,
- Examine how State policies affect household-level participation in SNAP, and
- Estimate the effect of SNAP participation on outcomes such as health and food spending by combining this data with nationally representative survey data.

#### Using Futures Prices to Forecast the Season-Average Price and Counter-Cyclical Payment Rate for Corn, Soybeans, and Wheat

Farmers and policymakers are interested in the level of counter-cyclical payments (CCPs) provided by the 2008 Farm Act to producers of selected commodities. CCPs are based on the season-average price received by farmers. (For more information on CCPs, see the ERS 2008 Farm Bill Side-By-Side, Title I: Commodity Programs.) 
 
This data product provides three Excel spreadsheet models that use futures prices to forecast the U.S. season-average price received and the implied CCP for three major field crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat). Users can view the model forecasts or create their own forecast by inserting different values for futures prices, basis values, or marketing weights. Example computations and data are provided on the Documentation page.

#### Spreadsheet Models
 
For each of the three major U.S. field crops, the Excel spreadsheet model computes a forecast for:

1. the national-level season-average price received by farmers and
2. the implied counter-cyclical payment rate.

Wind Erosion can be a threat to agriculture productivity and the sustainability of the earth’s natural resources.  The erosion of surface soil by wind renders the soil less productive by removing the most fertile part of the soil, namely, the clays and organic matter.  This removal of clay and organic matter reduces native productivity of the soil and damages soil structure and biological activity, which are essential soil qualities for a healthy soil resource.</p>
<p>In addition to soil loss, wind erosion can damage plants, primarily by the abrasive action of saltating particles on seedlings and fruits. Eroded soil can also be deposited into waterways where it impacts water quality and/or emitted into the air where it degrades the air resources. By affecting these resources, wind erosion can also become a health hazard to humans and other animals.</p>
<p>The ability to accurately simulate soil loss by wind is essential for, among other things, environmental and conservation planning, natural resource inventories, and reducing air and water pollution from wind-blown soil materials.</p>
<p>This site provides access to the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) software version used for official purposes by NRCS field offices and Technical Service providers.  NRCS developed and maintains the components of the WEPS Databases and information on this site. The USDA-Agricultural Research Service is the lead agency for developing the science in the WEPS model and the model interface.  WEPS predicts many forms of soil erosion by wind such as saltation-creep and suspension including PM-10. WEPS replaces the Wind Erosion Equation (WEQ) in use prior to January, 2008.  WEPS is a process-based, continuous, daily time-step model that simulates weather, field conditions, crop growth, hydrology and wind erosion.   Saltation, creep, suspension, and PM10 components of wind erosion are simulated and reported for a crop system. WEPS is designed to be used under a wide range of land use conditions in the U.S. and easily adapted to other parts of the world.</p>

<p>The database is searchable by Fungi, Hosts, Locations, Provenance, or Accessions. Results are provided in PDF format.</p>
<p>Catalog files are in the Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format and are readable with the Adobe Acrobat Reader.</p>
<p>All catalogs and live searches of isolate data incorporate the most current supportable taxonomies for ARSEF fungi. Significant changes in the nomenclatural rules for many fungi have a large and ongoing impact on the entomopathogens in the order Hypocreales. These changes are discussed the introductory material in the catalogs.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about the most current identifications for isolates, online searches of ARSEF accessions return taxonomic information in the collection database at the moment of the search.</p>

<ul>
<li>develop practical tools and protocols to measure antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in agriculturally-impacted soil, water, air, and food;</li>
<li>design and evaluate agricultural best management practices to limit the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance from agroecosystems;</li>
<li>facilitate sharing of ideas and resources among ARS scientists by establishing an agency-wide network of researchers with the common goal of conducting science-based research on AgAR topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS: Which drugs are the most relevant for each type of ag production system?  At what level do excreted drugs continue to provide selective pressure in the environment?</p>
<p>RESISTANT BACTERIA: What is the relative contribution of specific bacteria to resistance in human clinical settings?  Are some bacteria more likely than others to donate or receive resistance genes?  What is the relative contribution of clonal spread of pathogens versus horizontal gene transfer?</p>
<p>RESISTANT GENES: How long do specific types of genes persist in agricultural samples?  What conditions increase or decrease the likelihood of a successful transfer in manure, soil, water, and air?  What is the role of the natural soil ""resistome""?</p>
<p>AgAR Network Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect ARS researchers at multiple locations in order to develop and assess methods for measuring resistance that are robust, and that are validated across production systems and geographical areas.</li>
<li>Identify which types of resistance are relevant to measure, based on an understanding of individual production systems and prioritized human health threats as identified by WHO and CDC</li>
<li>Encourage the collection of baseline data and control samples so that the impact of agricultural best management practices can be accurately determined.</li>
<li>Assess persistence of antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in environmental and pre-harvest settings.</li>
<li>Long term goal: Discover the details of how, and at what rate bacteria and genes move back and forth between animals and humans through agricultural systems (soil, water, air wildlife, insects, and food).</li>
</ul>
<p>The AgAR network is composed of ARS scientists with an interest in understanding the ecology of antibiotic resistance in soil, water, air, insects, wildlife, and food. The network currently represents 4 national programs at 10 ARS locations across the United States, with over 200 peer-reviewed publications on AgAR topics, authored and co-authored by over 70 current and former ARS employees.</p>
<p>Activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate routine communication between AgAR members to address priority research areas, encourage agency and location wide collaboration and minimize research overlap.</li>
<li>Establish a framework for the cross-laboratory validation of AgAR methods.</li>
<li>Serve as a resource to scientists, stakeholders and administrators on current and past projects that address AgAR.</li>
<li>Provide a point of contact for agency coordinators to solicit information and transmit agency goals to relevant research groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importance:</p>
<p>While there is broad agreement the use of antibiotics in food animals has the potential to adversely impact human clinical outcomes, the details of how this happens are unknown, and there is a critical need for information on antibiotic resistance (AR) in agricultural settings (AgAR).  U.S. and international health organizations have taken the lead on identifying specific antibiotic drugs and resistant infections that are critical to human health. ARS is uniquely positioned to provide information on the ""farm"" side of the ""farm to fork continuum"". ARS scientists are able to address these questions in a practical way, by combining their experience (over 200 peer-reviewed ARS publications on antibiotic resistance) with their applied understanding of agricultural production systems.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATION: Scientists work on their own, individual research projects. The AgAR network provides resources to participants to encourage collaboration across program areas and geographical location.</p>
<p>MANAGEMENT: The AgAR network is operated using a wiki community approach. All participating scientists are encouraged to contribute to and share in the community resources.   Currently, the group resources will be curated by the group coordinator, with input and guidance from a five person advisory panel.</p>

This discrepancy indicates a significant gap in our mechanistic understanding of carbon and nutrient cycling in these systems. Recent research suggests that certain drivers of decomposition that are often not explicitly incorporated into models (e.g., photodegradation and soil-litter mixing; SLM) may be important in drylands, and their exclusion may, in part, be responsible for model under-predictions. To assess the role of SLM, litterbags were deployed in the Chihuahuan Desert and interrelationships between vegetation structure, SLM, and rates of decomposition were quantified. Vegetation structure was manipulated to simulate losses of grass cover from livestock grazing and shrub encroachment.

This database was developed to be used in conjunction with the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework Toolkit.</p>
<p>Data comprise soil survey information and land use. Soil characterization data were extracted from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Soil Survey Staff, 2013). Land use coverages were developed to represent agricultural fields and the types and rotations of agricultural crops and other land cover types. Land use boundaries were produced by editing a publicly available USDA field boundaries dataset (pre-2008), with all ownership and county-level attributes removed. To ensure these field polygons were consistent with recent land use, the 2009 Cropland Data Layer (USDA-NASS, 2013) was examined for all fields larger than 16 ha. For those fields with multiple cover types, 2009 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial photography was used as a basis to manually edit field boundaries. A field was considered to have multiple cover types and was edited if the dominant cover occupied &lt;75% of the field, as indicated by the 2009 Cropland Data Layer. Updated field boundaries were then overlaid with data from USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (2013) Cropland Data Layer for 2000 – 2014, and each field was classified to represent crop rotations and land cover using the most recent six-year (2009-2014) sequence of land cover.  Six-year land-cover strings (e.g., corn-corn-soybean-corn-soybean-corn) generated for each field were classified to represent major crop rotations, which were dominantly comprised of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) annual row crops.</p>
<p>The database does not include high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey data, although these are needed by the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework Toolkit and must be obtained independently.</p>

These toolsets identify agricultural fields most prone to deliver runoff directly to streams, map and classify riparian zones to inform whole-watershed riparian corridor management, and estimate the extent of tile drainage in the watershed. The software maps out suites of locations appropriate to install each of several types of conservation practices.

Plant development is temperature driven, with duration of growth stages dependent on degree days. Each plant species has a defined base temperature and optimum temperature. The simulation of competition for light is based on Beer's law, allowing a different extinction coefficient (k) for each species. Light is partitioned between species based on k-values, leaf area index (LAI) and plant heights. LAI, light interception with Beer's law, and potential daily biomass increase with a species-specific value of radiation use efficiency (RUE). The model simulates competition for water and nutrients based on each species' current rooting zone and demand by each species. The daily increases in and biomass are reduced when plant-available water in the current rooting depth is insufficient to meet potential evapotranspiration. Total biomass is simulated with radiation use efficiency and grain yield with a harvest index approach, sensitive to water stress. Grain yield is simulated based on harvest index (HI), which is the grain yield as a fraction of the total aboveground dry matter at maturity.</p>
<p>Simulations using the BatchRun section of ALMANAC will create outputs for more than one scenario at a time. BatchRuns allow ALMANAC users to perform many runs at a time. For an example of BatchRun in use, see Dr. Behrman's '<a href=""https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/12-0436.1"">Spatial forecasting of switchgrass productivity under current and future climate change scenarios</a>' with simulations across the eastern half of the United States.</p>
<p>Soil, weather, tillage, and crop parameter are essential inputs for the model. Users typically access the extensive NRCS soils data, and readily available daily weather data, such as NOAA, for inputs. See HowtoSoils and NOAAfiles for downloading and ALMANAC formatting instructions. Weather inputs require values of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, and solar radiation. ALMANAC contains a weather generator subroutine, based on concepts of the WGEN model. The generator is used when weather is not available, or the user does not wish to use or format existing data. Users can make runs with several years of weather in a few minutes, enabling them to efficiently simulate an extensive range of management, crop, and soil scenarios. Tillage requires users to select or create management data. ALMANAC offers a wide range of tillage operations including drainage, irrigation, fertilization, furrow diking, and liming. We recommend obtaining field data to gain parameters for new plants, or yield data of established plants to calibrate and validate simulations. Parameters for describing plant processes are easy to derive for a plant species or cultivar (see Sampling Protocol Standard with Photos). After parameters for describing plant processes are derived for a plant species or cultivar they are easily transfer among the models here in Temple (EPIC, APEX, SWAT).</p>
<p>ALMANAC is an important decision making tool with proven parameters and simulations that have been applied to many crop prediction and natural resource problems. ALMANAC can assist with future crop predictions such as how much biomass will be produced, what plant will be successful where, when is the optimal time to harvest, the effect of management on competing species, and management adjustment effects on land. ALMANAC is also used in natural resources regarding climate change, soil erosion, risk assessment, management decisions, plant competition, conservation effects and climate change on soil, water, competition. With this model users can determine how a plant will yield across time, how nutrients and water pass through the system, and how plants will be affected by management changes. We input real world field data into plant parameters used for the model, this enables our simulations to be more precise. The model has been used in nationwide assessments, ecosystem studies, biofuels, and for individual farmer fields.</p>
<p>ALMANAC has also been developed for Mexico. The ALMANACMEX  model is an output of  research collaboration between  the United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and the  Mexican National Institute of Agricultural, Forestry and Livestock Research (INIFAP).</p>

Archived and distributed through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC), the Daymet dataset for Goodwin Creek provides gridded estimates of daily weather parameters for North America, including daily continuous surfaces of minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation occurrence and amount, humidity, shortwave radiation, snow water equivalent, and day length. The Goodwin Creek site is located in the Bluff Hills, just east of the Mississippi River valley. In addition to being a core AmeriFlux site, Goodwin Creek is affiliated with a multitude of other projects including Surface Radiation (SURFRAD), Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), and is one of twelve USDA Conservation Reserve Program watersheds. Natural disturbances are of minimal influence to the site. The immediate region is primarily used for grazing while infrequent logging activities occur in nearby forests. The grass surrounding the base of the tower is mowed periodically to maintain a height consistent with the regional grasslands.<br />
               Daymet is supported by funding from NASA through the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Program. The continued development of the Daymet algorithm and processing is also supported by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research within the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science.</p>

Results of desertification on the Jornada include changes to shrub dominated communities and major soil changes.

If grassland systems respond to rainfall without significant lags, but shrub systems do not, then consumer species should reflect these differences. In addition, shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We have hypothesized that consumer populations, diversity, and densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands than in shrublands. Diversity and/or densities are hypothesized to be related to the NPP of the sites. Data will be collected for the duration of the LTER program in order to provide data to test these hypotheses.

<p>Blueberry (<em>Vaccinium corymbosum</em>) is a major berry crop in the United States. Next generation sequencing methodologies, such as 454, have been demonstrated to be successful and efficient in producing a snap-shot of transcriptional activities during an organism’s developmental stage(s) or its response to biotic or abiotic stresses. Such application of this new sequencing technique allows for high-throughput, genome-wide experimental verification of known and novel transcripts. We have applied a high-throughput pyrosequencing technology (454 EST sequencing) for transcriptome profiling of blueberry during different stages of fruit development to gain an understanding of the genes that are up or down regulated during this process. We have also sequenced flower buds at four different stages of cold acclimation to gain a better understanding of the genes and biochemical pathways that are up- or down-regulated during cold acclimation, since extreme low temperatures are known to reduce crop yield and cause major losses to US farmers. We have also sequenced a leaf sample to compare its transcriptome profile with that of bud and fruit samples. Over 500,000 sequences were generated and assembled into approximately 15,000 contigs and were annotated and functionally mapped to Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A database was developed to house these sequences and their annotations. A web based interface was also developed to allow collaborators to search\browse the data and aid in the analysis and interpretation of the data. The availability of these sequences will allow for future advances, such as the development of a blueberry microarray to study gene expression, and will aid in the blueberry genome sequencing effort that is underway.<br />

<p>To gain a better understanding of changes in gene expression associated with cold acclimation in blueberry, the Rowland laboratory (USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD)  has undertaken a genomics approach based on the analysis of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs).

About 100 3’-end ESTs were generated from the cold-acclimated library as well.</p>

The treatments are designed to distinguish the effects of plant biomass per se from those of plant functional groups and plant species richness within functional groups. We recorded the mass of plants removed from the plots when the treatments were imposed in 1995; the total biomass removed from a plot is an index of the disturbance associated with the start of the experiment. One hypothesis is that plant biomass, rather than the species or functional group composition of the plants, is the critical regulator of ecosystem function. If so, most response variables would be highly correlated with initial biomass removed in the early seasons of the experiment. If remaining species increase in biomass over time, to the point where all treatments support approximately equal biomass, that correlation (and the differences among treatments) should disappear. Another hypothesis is that the architecture and physiology of different groups of plants differ sufficiently that each functional group contributes in a unique way to ecosystem function. We therefore are testing the impact of removing various groups or growth forms from the plant community. Four treatments involve the removal of all individuals of all species of a given functional group of perennial plants: shrubs, subshrubs, perennial grasses, and succulents (both leaf and stem succulents). That is, one treatment involves the removal of all shrubs from a plot; another the removal of all perennial grasses, and so on. All other treatments (Control plus three other treatments) contain at least some species representative of all functional groups, so the contrast between the functional group removals and these other treatments should reflect the effect of functional group diversity. There are multiple species in each of the functional groups, so an additional hypothesis is that higher species richness within a functional group alters ecosystem function significantly. We have imposed a Simplified treatment, where only a single species (the most abundant species at the time of initiation) of each of the four groups remains, and all other species of those functional groups have been removed. That is, the Simplified plots contain a single shrub (Larrea tridentata), a single subshrub (Zinnia acerosa), a single succulent (Yucca baccata), and a single perennial grass (Muhlenbergia porteri). In contrast, we have also imposed two versions of a Reduced diversity treatment, where the dominant species have been removed and the subordinate species remain. (In one version of this treatment, Larrea is assumed to be the dominant shrub and was removed; in another version, Prosopis is assumed to be dominant and is removed. In both of these, the dominants of other growth forms are as identified above in the Simplified treatment.) Finally, in the Control, all species (dominant and subordinate) of all four functional groups remain. Hence the contrast among the Control, the Reduced, and the Simplified treatments should reflect the importance of species richness within functional groups. Response variables: The vegetation transects are measured once or twice a year to assess the response of the plant community to the manipulations of species and functional diversity. (Measurements are every fall at a minimum. When resources permit and vegetation seems to deserve it, spring sampling will also be carried out (2 x per year)</p>

The chart, patterned after the periodic table of elements, includes information on 58 crop species that may be planted individually or in cocktail mixtures. Information on growth cycle, relative water use, plant architecture, seeding depth,  forage quality, pollination characteristics, and nutrient cycling are included for most crop species.</p>
<p>The Cover Crop Chart is easy to use, requiring only Adobe Acrobat software. Using the chart as a guide, users can select individual crop species by clicking on the name which will direct them to additional information about the selected crop. Icons within each crop page return the user to the chart, thereby easily allowing comparisons of different crops.</p>
<p>The Cover Crop Chart represents a compendium of information from multiple sources throughout the U.S. and Canada, and is not based on research conducted at the USDA-ARS Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL). Primary sources of information included the Midwest Cover Crops Council, USDA - Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education (SARE), USDA - Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) PLANTS Database, relevant peer-reviewed journal articles, and the 3rd  edition of  *Managing Cover Crops Profitably* (Andy Clark, Editor).</p>
<p>Information on specific crops is occasionally generalized and/or approximate to accommodate wide variation in geographic/agronomic conditions, and therefore may not reflect performance in on-farm conditions. Accordingly, USDA - Agricultural Research Service (ARS) makes no guarantee to the performance of specific crops based on information provided within the Cover Crop Chart.</p>
<p>The Cover Crop Chart is produced and distributed by the staff of the USDA-ARS NGPRL, Mandan, ND. Mark Liebig and Holly Johnson contributed to the design and content of the chart with input from NGPRL staff and producers and technicians from the Area IV Soil Conservation Districts of North Dakota and NRCS staff at the Bismarck and Dickinson Field/Area Offices.</p>

Current and potential SCINet users are using and generating very large datasets so SCINet needs to be provisioned with adequate data storage for their active computing. It is not designed to hold data beyond active research phases. At the same time, the National Agricultural Library has been developing the Ag Data Commons, a research data catalog and repository designed for public data release and professional data curation. Ag Data Commons needs to anticipate the size and nature of data it will be tasked with handling.</p>
<p>The ARS Web-enabled Databases Working Group, organized under the SCINet initiative, conducted a study to establish baseline data storage needs and practices, and to make projections that could inform future infrastructure design, purchases, and policies. The SCINet Web-enabled Databases Working Group helped develop the survey which is the basis for an internal report. While the report was for internal use, the survey and resulting data may be generally useful and are being released publicly.</p>
<p>From October 24 to November 8, 2016 we administered a 17-question survey (Appendix A) by emailing a Survey Monkey link to all ARS Research Leaders, intending to cover data storage needs of all 1,675 SY (Category 1 and Category 4) scientists. We designed the survey to accommodate either individual researcher responses or group responses. Research Leaders could decide, based on their unit's practices or their management preferences, whether to delegate response to a data management expert in their unit, to all members of their unit, or to themselves collate responses from their unit before reporting in the survey.</p>
<p>Larger storage ranges cover vastly different amounts of data so the implications here could be significant depending on whether the true amount is at the lower or higher end of the range. Therefore, we requested more detail from ""Big Data users,"" those 47 respondents who indicated they had more than 10 to 100 TB or over 100 TB total current data (Q5).  All other respondents are called ""Small Data users."" Because not all of these follow-up requests were successful, we used actual follow-up responses to estimate likely responses for those who did not respond.</p>
<p>We defined active data as data that would be used within the next six months. All other data would be considered inactive, or archival.</p>
<p>To calculate per person storage needs we used the high end of the reported range divided by 1 for an individual response, or by G, the number of individuals in a group response. For Big Data users we used the actual reported values or estimated likely values.</p>

<p>The red flour beetle, <em>Tribolium castaneum</em> (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is a major pest of facilities where grain is processed because of its ability to find and colonize food resource patches. Traps baited with pheromone and kairomone lures are commonly used to monitor for the presence of insects in warehouses or flour mills, for example. However, two nonmutually exclusive components, environment and genetics, could influence insect responsiveness to volatiles, impacting the efficacy of monitoring. Intraspecific variation in attraction behavior to food and mates is largely unexplored in stored-product insects, but tapping into natural genetic variation could provide a baseline for identifying genetic mechanisms associated with finding resources. Here, we assess eight strains of <em>T. castaneum</em> for variation in response to kairomone- and pheromone-based lures using three behavioral assays: paired choice with no forced air flow, upwind attraction with forced air flow, and movement pattern in an arena with a single odor source. We find strain-specific responses to kairomones and pheromones and evidence for heritability in behavioral responses. However, environmental coefficients for behavioral responses to both lures are high, suggesting that environment, and its potential interaction with genotype, strongly influences behavioral outcomes in these assays. Furthermore, despite the different environmental conditions among the different behavioral assays, we find a correlation for volatile preference among the assays. Our results provide a baseline assessment of natural variation for preference to kairomone and pheromone lures and suggest that careful consideration of behavioral assay is key to understanding the mechanisms of attraction in these stored-product pests.</p>

<p>Genetic and genomic tools for Culicoides biting midges are lacking, despite the fact that they vector a large number of arboviruses and other pathogens impacting humans and domestic animals world-wide. Libraries of tissue-specific transcripts expressed in response to feeding and oral virus challenge in C. sonorensis have previously been reported, but extensive genome-wide expression profiling in the midge has not. Here, we successfully used deep sequencing technologies to construct the first adult female C. sonorensis reference transcriptome, and utilized genome-wide expression profiling to elucidate the genetic response to blood and sucrose feeding over time. The adult female midge unigene consists of 19,041 genes, of which less than 7% are differentially expressed during the course of a sucrose meal, while up to 52% of the genes respond significantly in blood-fed midges, indicating hematophagy induces complex physiological processes. Many genes that were differentially expressed during blood feeding were associated with digestion (e.g. proteases, lipases), hematophagy (e.g., salivary proteins), and vitellogenesis, revealing many major metabolic and biological factors underlying these critical processes. Additionally, key genes in the vitellogenesis pathway were identified, which provides the first glimpse into the molecular basis of anautogeny for C. sonorensis. This is the first extensive transcriptome for this genus, which will serve as a framework for future expression studies and in informing a reference genome assembly and annotation. Moreover, this study will serve as a foundation for subsequent studies of genome-wide expression analyses during early virus infection and dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind vector competence in midges.</p>

<p>This dataset is supplemental to the article ""A hydrological modeling dataset for the Johnston Draw catchment, Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA,"" which was submitted to <em>Water Resources Research</em> in December 2015.</p>
<p>The data includes time-series measurements of precipitation at three different gauges (124, 125, and 124b) at the Johnston Draw watershed, a sub-watershed of the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory. The Johnston Draw watershed was established by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in 2002 to study the rain-snow transition zone. Data was collected at gauges 124 and 125 from October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2014 and at gauge 124b from November 11, 2006 through September 30, 2014.</p>
<p>Precipitation for 124 and 125 were wind-corrected using the dual-gauge method described by Hanson et al. (2004). Precipitation for 124b was wind-corrected using wind data and the standard World Meteorological Organization (WMO) method as applied by Yang et al. (1999). The percent snow was calculated using the methods developed by Marks et al. (2013), using the during-storm dew point temperature (Td) where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Td &lt; ­‐0.5 °C  100 % Snow</li>
<p>­
<li>‐0.5 °C &gt;= Td &lt; 0 °C  75 % Snow</li>
<li>0 °C &lt;= Td &lt; +0.5 °C  25 % Snow</li>
<li>0.5 °C &lt;= Td  0 % Snow</li>

(Diptera: Muscidae), is one of the most significant pests of livestock in the United States. The identification of targets for the development of novel control for this pest species, focusing on those molecules that play a role in successful feeding and reproduction, is critical to mitigating its impact on confined and rangeland livestock. This data set was obtained from pyrosequencing of stable fly immature and adult specimens, comprising genes expressed at these stages. Stable fly specimens were obtained from an in vitro colony that is maintained at the Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory (Kerrville, TX) at 27°C, 60% RH, and a photoperiod of 12:12 [L:D] h. The stages included 1 g each of newly laid (t0) and 24 h post-oviposition (t24) embryos, 5 g of pooled 2nd–3rd instar larvae (late larvae), 2.5 g newly pupariated pupae (early pupae), 5 g pharate adults (pupae 2 d prior to eclosion; late pupae), and 1.5 g each of heads from unfed adult females and males (adult). Total RNA was isolated from various stages using the ToTALLY RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Five micrograms of normalized cDNA was prepared for sequencing on the 454/ Roche GS-FLX. Double-stranded cDNA was nebulized to generate nominal 500-kb fragments and a shotgun library prepared for GS-FLX sequencing as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The sequencing library was run on a full picotitre plate and resulting data submitted to NCBI Short Read Archive (SRX018014). The resulting sequence data was assembled using newbler (RocheN) and the assembly optimized using a beta version of NGEN (DNAstar, Madison, WI) and Seqman (DNAstar, Oxford, UK). BLASTx was utilized based upon W.ND-BLAST (Dowd et al., 2005) against an embl-derived database for Drosophila (2008). Functional annotations were derived using DAVID (Dennis et al., 2003).</p>
<p>Raw reads were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) Database at NCBI.</p>

The proportion to be removed is determined by the bloom intensity, i.e., the number of flowers present in the orchard. Several automated computer vision systems have been proposed to estimate bloom intensity, but their overall performance is still far from satisfactory even in relatively controlled environments. With the goal of devising a technique for flower identification which is robust to clutter and to changes in illumination, this paper presents a method in which a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is fine-tuned to become specially sensitive to flowers. Experimental results on a challenging dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms three approaches that represent the state of the art in flower detection, with recall and precision rates higher than 90%. Moreover, a performance assessment on three additional datasets previously unseen by the network, which consist of different flower species and were acquired under different conditions, reveals that the proposed method highly surpasses baseline approaches in terms of generalization capability.  This dataset comprises mp4 video sequences illustrating each combination of datasets and methods.</p>

The unique study presented here assessed seed metabolomic and ionomic diversity in a soybean (<em>Glycine max</em>) lineage representing ~35 years of breeding (launch years 1972–2008) and increasing yield potential. Selected varieties included six conventional and three genetically modified (GM) glyphosate-tolerant lines. A metabolomics approach utilizing capillary electrophoresis (CE)-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), gas chromatography (GC)-TOF-MS and liquid chromatography (LC)-quadrupole (q)-TOFMS resulted in measurement of a total of 732 annotated peaks. Ionomics through inductively-coupled plasma (ICP)-MS profiled twenty mineral elements. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of the seed data successfully differentiated newer higher-yielding soybean from earlier lower-yielding accessions at both field sites. This result reflected genetic fingerprinting data that demonstrated a similar distinction between the newer and older soybean. Correlation analysis also revealed associations between yield data and specific metabolites. There were no clear metabolic differences between the conventional and GM lines. Overall, observations of metabolic and genetic differences between older and newer soybean varieties provided novel and significant information on the impact of varietal development on biochemical variability. Proposed applications of omics in food and feed safety assessments will need to consider that GM is not a major source of metabolite variability and that trait development in crops will, of necessity, be associated with biochemical variation.</p>

Genetic structure analysis showed that the collection was structured into two main groups, corresponding roughly to the cultivated types/landraces and the more primitive form species and subspecies, with some intermediates. Linkage disequilibrium of pairwise loci and population structure of the collection were analyzed, and an association analysis between SNP genotypes and 25 valuable traits such as disease resistance, seed type/color, flower color, seed low molecular weight carbohydrate concentration, and seed mineral nutrient concentration was performed using a mixed linear model.

New genetic resources could accelerate genetic gain in cranberry through characterization of its genomic structure and by enabling molecular-assisted breeding strategies. To increase the availability of cranberry genomic resources, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was used to discover and genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within three interrelated cranberry full-sib populations. Additional simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were added to the SNP datasets and used to construct bin maps for the parents of the populations, which were then merged to create the first high-density cranberry composite map containing 6073 markers (5437 SNPs and 636 SSRs) on 12 linkage groups (LGs) spanning 1124 cM. Interestingly, higher rates of recombination were observed in maternal than paternal gametes. The large number of markers in common (mean of 57.3) and the high degree of observed collinearity (mean Pair-wise Spearman rank correlations &gt;0.99) between the LGs of the parental maps demonstrates the utility of GBS in cranberry for identifying polymorphic SNP loci that are transferable between pedigrees and populations in future trait-association studies. Furthermore, the high-density of markers anchored within the component maps allowed identification of segregation distortion regions, placement of centromeres on each of the 12 LGs, and anchoring of genomic scaffolds. Collectively, the results represent an important contribution to the current understanding of cranberry genomic structure and to the availability of molecular tools for future genetic research and breeding efforts in cranberry.</p>

Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. <em>Aphis craccivora</em> and <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum</em> can harbor the symbiotic bacteria <em>Hamiltonella defensa</em> and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by <em>H. defensa</em> defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of <em>H. defensa</em> on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, <em>Aphelinus</em> species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with <em>H. defensa</em> /APSE by two <em>Aphelinus</em> species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While <em>Aphelinus atriplicis</em> showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with <em>H. defensa</em> can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by <em>H. defensa</em> /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.</p>

No specific permissions were required to collect <em>Aphis craccivora</em> or <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum</em> because these are cosmopolitan aphids that occur in the field throughout North America. None of the species collected or studied are endangered or protected.</p>
<p><em>Aphis craccivora</em> is a cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is anholocyclic, i.e. reproduces asexually, throughout most of its range (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum</em> is an almost cosmopolitan pest of legumes and is holocyclic, i.e. alternates by asexual and sexual reproduction in temperature regions (Blackman and Eastop, 2006). <em>Aphis craccivora</em> in these experiments were collected originally in Kentucky, USA, in 2009, and <em>Ac. pisum</em> were collected in Utah, USA, in 2007. The aphids were cultured on fava bean, <em>Vicia faba</em> L., in 12 cm pots in plant growth chambers at 20°C and a 16L:8D h photoperiod. Isofemale lines were initiated from single female aphids on individual V. fava plants. Lines from the original populations tested positive for infection with only H. defensa using Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of 16S rRNA and confirmed with diagnostic PCR (Russell et al., 2013). APSE type 3 was found in <em>H. defensa</em> in <em>Ac. pisum</em> and APSE type 4 was found in <em>H. defensa</em> in <em>Ap. craccivora</em>. Aphid lines without <em>H. defensa</em> were generated by a selective curing technique in which aphids were fed an artificial diet that was treated with equal parts of the antibiotics gentamycin, defatoxiamine and ampicillin for 3 days, after which the aphids were placed on <em>V. fava</em> plants (Dykstra et al., 2014). Clearing of <em>H. defensa</em> from offspring of aphids from these lines was confirmed by PCR (Russell et al., 2013). Cured (AC1H-) and uncured lines (AC1H+) from <em>Ap. craccivora</em> and cured (AS3H-) and uncured lines (AS3H+) from <em>Ac. craccivora</em> were used for the experiments reported here. They were shipped to Newark, Delaware, USA, in spring 2012, where they were maintained for 40-50 generations prior to these experiments. Both cured and uncured lines were tested using diagnostic PCR for the presence of <em>H. defensa</em> and APSE prior to assays.</p>
<p><em>Aphelinus atriplicis</em> was collected as mummified <em>Diuraphis noxia</em> on wheat near Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, in 2000; <em>A. glycinis</em> was collected as mummified <em>Aphis glycines</em> Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on soybean near Xiuyan, Liaoning Province, Peoples Republic of China, in 2007. <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> was described from the culture used in this study (Hopper et al., 2012); <em>A. atriplicis</em> was described by Kurdjumov (1913), and the culture used in this study was included in a molecular phylogeny of species in the <em>Aphelinus varipes</em> complex (Heraty et al., 2007). Cultures were established in the quarantine facility at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA. The cultures were divided into 4-6 subcultures, and each subculture was maintained with an adult population size greater than 200 and sex ratio of 1:1 males:females. <em>Aphelinus atriplicis</em> was reared on <em>D. noxia</em> on barley, <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> L. (Poaceae); <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> was reared on <em>Aphis glycines</em> on soybean, <em>Glycine max</em> (L.) (Fabaceae). The culture of <em>D. noxia</em> was started in 1998 with aphids from southeastern Wyoming, and the culture of <em>A. glycines</em> was started in 2008 with aphids from Newark, Delaware. Neither <em>D. noxia</em> nor <em>A. glycines</em> are known to harbor <em>H. defensa</em>, and diagnostic PCR assays confirmed the absence of <em>H. defensa</em> in our colonies of these species. Although <em>A. glycines</em> harbors another bacterium, <em>Arsenophonus</em>, this secondary symbiont apparently does not protect against parasitoids (Wulff et al., 2013). All cultures were reared on appropriate host plant species in plant growth chambers at 20°C, 50-70% relative humidity, 16:8 h (L:D) photoperiod. Vouchers are maintained at -20°C in molecular-grade ethanol at the Beneficial Insect Introduction Research Unit, Newark, Delaware, USA.</p>
<h3>Parasitism and parasitoid fitness on aphids infected with <em>Hamiltonella defensa</em> versus uninfected aphids</h3>
<p>To measure the effect of infection with <em>H. defensa</em> harboring APSE on parasitism of <em>Ap. craccivora</em> and <em>Ac. craccivora</em>, as well as on parasitoid fitness components, we exposed individual, mated females of <em>Aphelinus atriplicis</em> or <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> that were less than 5 days old to either aphids infected with <em>H. defensa</em> or uninfected aphids on <em>V. faba</em> variety Windsor. Females were drawn at random from the replicated sub-populations used for rearing. Seeds were planted in 12 cm diameter x 12 cm tall pots with the same soil mix and fertilizer used for insect rearing and plants and insects were kept under the same conditions as described for insect rearing prior to use in experiments. We put each female parasitoid in a cage (polystyrene, 10 cm diameter by 22 cm tall, with eight 2.5 cm holes in the sides and a 12 cm hole in the top covered with fine-mesh screening) enclosing the foliage of 2-3 young fava bean plants in a pot with about 100 aphids, including 1-4 instar nymphs and adults. The aphids were transferred as colonies on excised leaves from our rearing cultures, and the excised leaves were placed on the experimental plants to allow the aphids to settle and feed two days before the parasitoids were added. Female parasitoids were removed after 7 days. <em>Aphelinus</em> females rarely superparasitize unless they are host limited (Bai and Mackauer, 1990; Hagen and VanDenBosch, 1968). Their lifetime fecundities are 100-300, and given that we exposed them to 100 aphids at the beginning of the experiments, and the aphids would produce more than 2000 progeny during the 7 day exposure, there were far more aphids than they could parasitize during this period so the likelihood of superparasitism is quite low.</p>
<p>The density of aphids, amount of plant material, and cage size meant that parasitoids were not limited by search rate.</p>
<p>Aphids parasitized by these <em>Aphelinus</em> species mummify about 7 days after being parasitized and adult parasitoids emerge 10 days after mummification. To ensure that aphids parasitized throughout the exposure period had time to mummify but would not yet have emerged as adults, we collected mummified aphids 7 days after the end of the exposure of aphids to parasitoids and held them for adult parasitoid emergence. After the adults emerged, we recorded the number of mummified aphids, the number of mummies from which adults emerged, and the number and sex of adult parasitoids. We dried the adult progeny of each female at 50°C for one hour and weighed the sexes separately on a microbalance. Because we scored parasitism after the larval parasitoids killed and mummified their hosts, which occurs during the parasitoid third instar, this measure of parasitism is a combination of acceptance of aphids for oviposition and suitability of aphids for parasitoid survival to third instar.</p>
<h3>Design structure</h3>
<p>The experiments on parasitism of each aphid species by each wasp species were designed as randomized complete-blocks blocks: location within rearing chamber was the blocking factor and each cage with a female parasitoid, aphids, and plants was an experimental unit. There were 48 experimental units each for <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> on <em>Ap. craccivora</em> and <em>Aphelinus atriplicis</em> on <em>Ap. craccivora</em> and on <em>Ac. pisum</em> (24 each for <em>Hamiltonella</em>-infected versus uninfected aphids).</p>

A recently identified WSMV resistance gene, <em>Wsm2</em>, was mapped to chromosome 3BS in germplasm line 'CO960293–2'. Effective genetic markers tightly linked to the gene will enhance the selection of WSMV-resistant lines through marker-assisted selection. We have mapped Wsm2 using a high-density map developed from the wheat 90K Infinium iSelect single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array with recombinant inbred lines from the cross between CO960293–2 and susceptible cultivar 'TAM 111'. Array-based SNPs that mapped within 4 cM of <em>Wsm2</em> on chromosome 3BS were converted to Kompetitive Allele Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (KASP) assays in this study. Six KASP SNPs were validated in two doubled haploid populations developed from crosses of 'RonL' × 'Ripper' and 'Snowmass' × 'Antero'. RonL and Snowmass possess the <em>Wsm2</em> gene from CO960293–2. Three closely linked KASP SNPs, converted from IAAV6442, BS00018764_51, and wsnp_Ra_c16264_24873670, showed high sensitivity and specificity (0.83 ≤ sensitivity ≤ 0.97, 0.89 ≤ specificity ≤ 0.99). The latter two were also validated in six F2 breeding populations. These three KASP SNPs were effective in differentiating resistant and susceptible genotypes. Comparative mapping was performed using sequences of SNPs flanking <em>Wsm2</em> and identified candidate genes and regions in <em>Brachypodium</em> and rice (<em>Oryza sativa</em> L. ssp. <em>japonica</em>). The KASP SNPs developed in this study should be useful for marker-assisted selection of <em>Wsm2</em> in wheat breeding programs, and the newly constructed map will also facilitate map based cloning of <em>Wsm2</em>.</p>

Microbial mechanisms may control O2-dependent uptake/release of P in stream sediments and biofilms, but specific organisms responsible for these cycles have not been identified. Polyphosphate Accumulating Organisms (PAOs) are purposely enriched in treatment plants to remove P from wastewater. PAOs release P under anaerobic conditions and take it up under aerobic conditions. It is hypothesized that alternating aerobic/anaerobic conditions promote patterns of P uptake/release similar to those attributed to PAOs in wastewater treatment. Intact, native stream biofilms were collected in the Cascadilla Creek Watershed in Tompkins County, New York, and subjected to laboratory treatments to impose conditions similar to what may occur because of diel oxygenic and respiratory cycles: 1) continuous sparging with air and 2) alternate sparging with air or anaerobic gas (20∶80% by volume CO2∶N2).  PO43−, Ca, Mg, total Mn, K, Fe2+, and total S (TS) concentrations in the water were monitored and total P (TP) and polyphosphate (polyP) concentrations in the biofilms at the start and end of the experiment.

The whitefly (<em>Bemisia tabaci</em>) vector of <em>Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus</em> (CYSDV), <em>Melon chlorotic leaf curl virus</em> (MCLCuV), and <em>Squash vein yellowing virus</em> (SqVYV) was observed in fields with numbers increasing during the season. Four samplings of crowns, peduncles, and/or leaves of symptomatic plants were made in March and April 2015. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic plant tissue and tested by RT-PCR for SqVYV, CYSDV, <em>Papaya ringspot virus</em> (PRSV), and/or begomoviruses. Primers specific for the coat protein gene of SqVYV (1020 bp), CYSDV (707 bp), or PRSV (511 bp), and degenerate begomovirus primers (1159 or 533 bp) amplified products of the expected sizes from 15 of 24, 20 of 24, 4 of 24, or 8 of 8 plants, respectively. SqVYV amplicons from six individual plants from the fourth sampling, SqVYV and CYSDV amplicons from a pool of plants from the third sampling, and degenerate begomovirus amplicons from the second sampling were cloned in the pGEM-T vector. Five clones of each amplicon were sequenced in both directions and representative consensus sequences were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. KT007178 to KT007183). Sequence analysis demonstrated that SqVYV coat protein gene sequences from Guatemala shared 99 to 100% nucleotide (nt) identity with each other, and 97 to 98% nt identity with divergent SqVYV isolates previously described from Florida (e.g., WM2005aHi, GenBank Accession No. JF897974) and California (GenBank Accession No. KP218061), but only 90% nt identity with the predominant SqVYV isolate found in Florida (e.g., Sq2003Hi, GenBank Accession No. EU259611) . Tissue blots were prepared from crowns and peduncles from the first, third, and fourth samplings, and tested by tissue blot nucleic acid hybridization assay for SqVYV. Tissue blots indicated SqVYV infection in an additional 48 of 102 watermelon samples, and cylindrical inclusions typical of SqVYV were observed in phloem tissue from the fourth sampling by light microscopy, confirming the identification of SqVYV. This is the first report of SqVYV infecting watermelon in Central America.</p>

There are two sweetpotato germplasm collections (Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit and US Vegetable Laboratory) maintained by the USDA, ARS for sweetpotato crop improvement. To date, no genome-wide assessment of genetic diversity within these collections has been reported in the published literature. In our study, population structure and genetic diversity of 417 USDA sweetpotato accessions originating from 8 broad geographical regions (Africa, Australia, Caribbean, Central America, Far East, North America, Pacific Islands, and South America) were determined using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified with a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocol, GBSpoly, optimized for highly heterozygous and polyploid species. Population structure using Bayesian clustering analyses (STRUCTURE) with 32,784 segregating SNPs grouped the accessions into four genetic groups and indicated a high degree of mixed ancestry. A neighbor-joining cladogram and principal components analysis based on a pairwise genetic distance matrix of the accessions supported the population structure analysis. Pairwise FST values between broad geographical regions based on the origin of accessions ranged from 0.017 (Far East – Pacific Islands) to 0.110 (Australia – South America) and supported the clustering of accessions based on genetic distance. The markers developed for use with this collection of accessions provide an important genomic resource for the sweetpotato community, and contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity present within the US sweetpotato collection and the species.</p>

ATUMI feeds on both fruits and bee nest products, facilitating its spread and increasing its impact on honey bees and other pollinators. The ATUMI genome has been sequenced and annotated, providing the first genomic resources for this species and for the Nitidulidae, a beetle family that is closely related to the extraordinarily species-rich clade of beetles known as the Phytophaga. ATUMI thus provides a contrasting view as a neighbor for one of the most successful known animal groups. A robust genome assembly and a gene set possessing 97.5% of the core proteins known from the holometabolous insects are presented. The ATUMI genome encodes fewer enzymes for plant digestion than the genomes of wood-feeding beetles, but nonetheless shows signs of broad metabolic plasticity. Gustatory receptors are few in number compared to other beetles, especially receptors with known sensitivity (in other beetles) to bitter substances. In contrast, several gene families implicated in detoxification of insecticides and adaptation to diverse dietary resources show increased copy numbers. The presence and diversity of homologs involved in detoxification differs substantially from the bee hosts of ATUMI. Results provide new insights into the genomic basis for local adaption and invasiveness in ATUMI, and a blueprint for control strategies that target this pest without harming their honey bee hosts. A minimal set of gustatory receptors is consistent with the observation that, once a host colony is invaded, food resources are predictable. Unique detoxification pathways and pathway members can help identify which treatments might control this species even in the presence of honey bees, which are notoriously sensitive to pesticides.</p>

However, it is rarely a pest in Eurasia, its area of origin, and research has shown that natural enemies can limit its abundance there. Among the most important of natural enemies of D. noxia in Eurasia are parasitoids in the genus Aphelinus. These data are results of laboratory experiments on host specificity of ten populations of seven species from two species complexes in the genus Aphelinus. Host specificity was not related to host plant species or the phylogenetic relatedness of the aphids or the parasitoids. While some species had very broad host ranges and others had intermediate host ranges, Aphelinus hordei had a very narrow host range, being restricted primarily to species in the genus Diuraphis, and especially D. noxia. We also report the results of experiments on the mechanisms of this host specificity. Most of the host specificity of A. hordei can be explained by differences in the behavior of females when they encountered different aphid species. Females of A. hordei rarely approach, sting, oviposit or host feed on aphids outside the genus Diuraphis, and they oviposit most frequently in D. noxia. From these results, we conclude that A. hordei is an excellent candidate for introduction into the USA to control D. noxia.</p>

In the model, recruitment and mortality of adult bees have substantial social components, with recruitment enhanced and mortality reduced by additional adult bee numbers. The result is an Allee effect, a net per-individual rate of hive increase that increases as a function of adult bee numbers. The Allee effect creates a critical minimum size in adult bee numbers, below which mortality is greater than recruitment, with ensuing loss of viability of the hive. Under ordinary and favorable environmental circumstances, the critical size is low, and hives remain large, sending off viably-sized swarms (naturally or through beekeeping management) when hive numbers approach an upper stable equilibrium size (carrying capacity). However, both the lower critical size and the upper stable size depend on many parameters related to demographic rates and their enhancement by bee sociality. Any environmental factors that increase mortality, decrease recruitment, or interfere with the social moderation of these rates has the effect of exacerbating the Allee effect by increasing the lower critical size and substantially decreasing the upper stable size. As well, the basin of attraction to the upper stable size, defined by the model potential function, becomes narrower and shallower, indicating the loss of resilience as the hive becomes subjected to increased risk of falling below the critical size. Environmental effects of greater severity can cause the two equilibria to merge and the basin of attraction to the upper stable size to disappear, resulting in collapse of the hive from any initial size. The model suggests that multiple proximate causes, among them pesticides, mites, pathogens, and climate change, working singly or in combinations, could trigger hive collapse.

We performed a common garden weed seed burial study at the University of Illinois Crop Sciences Research and Education Center in Savoy, IL (40.048757 N, -88.237206 E), from October 2007 through October 2012. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with four replications of the sub-plot variable species nested within main plot variable burial duration (1 to 5 years). Eleven annual weed species were included, spanning a broad range of seed sizes, dormancy types and seedbank persistence: <em>Abutilon theophrasti</em> Medik (velvetleaf), <em>Ambrosia trifida</em> L.

<p>Weed seeds were collected in 2007 from the experimental site and adjoining fields by gently shaking mature inflorescences over a bucket and bulking seeds from multiple plants to form a composite sample for each species. Light seed were removed by processing with a seed cleaner, after which seeds were stored in air tight containers at 4C until burial. Immediately prior to burial, seed viability was assayed with tetrazolium. Burial units consisted of 100 seeds of a given species placed in the bottom of a 2.5 cm deep square tray, 10 cm on a side, made of 0.5 mm stainless steel wire mesh. Tray bottoms were permeable to water, but prevented seeds from escaping. Trays were filled 2 cm deep with soil from a nearby grass sward that had not been cropped for over 30 years, to avoid contamination with weed seeds (verified by elutriating samples of this soil). Within each experimental unit, we excavated a 2 cm deep rectangle 30 cm wide by 40 cm long, and placed trays for each of the 11 species side by side into this depression so that their soil surface was flush with the surrounding soil, leaving a 0.5 cm wire mesh lip exposed in each tray. Each experimental unit was covered by wire mesh with 1 cm square openings to permit access to invertebrate granivores. The study plot was fenced to exclude large vertebrates.</p>
<p>Seedling emergence was recorded weekly from March through October every year. Seed trays for a given burial duration treatment were removed in October of the assigned year and seeds recovered via elutriation (Wiles et al. 1996). Recovered seeds were incubated under oscillating temperature conditions (15 C/dark for 10 hr, 25 C/light for 14 hr) for 2 weeks and germination recorded.

We measured chemical and physical seed traits on freshly collected seeds following the methods outlined in Tiansawat et al. (2014), using multiple measures of each trait class to provide functional redundancy and allow them to be treated as latent or manifest variables during multivariate analyses. For the chemical defense trait class we measured ortho-dihydroxyphenol (o-DHP) concentration, abundance and diversity of phenolic compounds quantified with high performance liquid chromatography, impact of seed homogenate on brine shrimp survival, and seed removal by invertebrate granivores. Physical traits measured included seed coat thickness, seed mass, and seed coat rupture force. Pairwise interspecific phylogenetic distances were quantified using the phydist subroutine of Phylocom 4.2 (<a href=""http://www.phylodiversity.net"">www.phylodiversity.net</a>). Also included is a list of references from the associated literature review.</p>

This data set was generated in order to use deep RNA sequencing to further characterize microbial diversity in CCD and non-CCD hives. We identified novel strains of the recently described Lake Sinai viruses (LSV) and found evidence of a shift in gut bacterial composition that may be a biomarker of CCD. The results are discussed with respect to host-parasite interactions and other environmental stressors of honey bees.</p>
<p>RNA was pooled by combining equal aliquots from each CCD or non-CCD colony described above. Five µg of RNA from the “CCD−” pool was used to generate cDNA using a cocktail of random heptamer primers. cDNA was size-selected from agarose and end-polished with End Repair Enzyme (Illumina) following manufacturer protocols. A 3′ polyadenine tract was then added with Klenow fragment (Invitrogen) and the products purified with a Qiaquick DNA purification column (Qiagen). Illumina adapters were ligated to cDNA with T4 DNA ligase and the products were amplified under the following thermocycler conditions: an initial denaturing step at 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 14 cycles at 98°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. Final products of 100–300 bp were size-selected from agarose and sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer by the Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore.</p>
<p>Equivalently prepared cDNA from the “CCD+” pool was sequenced using a paired-end strategy with a 350-bp fragment size. A paired-end approach facilitates the assembly of longer contigs, and therefore may provide more diagnostic sequences for annotation, but at a cost of reduced read length (67 bp). Both sequencing runs were quality-trimmed by retaining only the longest contiguous sequence of each read with a minimum (Phred-equivalent) quality score of 15, excepting at most one ambiguous base. Reads less than 50 bp after this trimming step were discarded. A small number of reads were removed because they matched Illumina primer sequence in the Univec database (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html"">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html</a>).</p>
<p>Reads were assembled into contigs using the Velvet assembly package [24]. CCD− reads were assembled into contigs using multiple iterations of Velvet with successive hash lengths of 21, 31, 41, 51, or 61. Contigs of less than 100 bp or with less than 3X coverage were discarded. This assembly strategy was chosen to accommodate the broad spectrum of RNA sources in the sample (viruses, a diverse bacterial community, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as the host genome) that are likely to have different optimal hash lengths for assembly. CCD+ reads were assembled in a similar fashion without read-pair information; in addition, a single paired-end assembly was performed with Velvet using a hash length of 21 and an expected fragment length of 350. Contigs from all intermediate assemblies were then merged using the BlastClust component of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) at 98% identity and 90% nonreciprocal overlap. Because there was substantial redundancy of contigs remaining after this step, we input the contigs to CAP3 [25] for more aggressive assembly, requiring a 60-bp overlap with 92% identity. Raw reads are available as accessions SRX028143 and SRX028145 of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive, however, the resulting contigs were not submitted because of an NCBI policy against hosting assemblies from mixed sources.</p>

However, there remains a need for imputation-free GBS methods for genotyping large samples taken from heterogeneous populations of heterozygous individuals. This requires that a number of issues encountered with GBS be considered, including the sequencing of nonoverlapping sets of loci across multiple GBS libraries, a common missing data problem that results in low call rates for markers per individual, and a tendency for applicability only in inbred line samples with sufficient linkage disequilibrium for accurate imputation. We addressed these issues while developing and validating a new, comprehensive platform for GBS. This study supports the notion that GBS can be tailored to particular aims, and using <em>Zea mays</em> our results indicate that large samples of unknown pedigree can be genotyped to obtain complete and accurate GBS data. Optimizing size selection to sequence a high proportion of shared loci among individuals in different libraries and using simple in silico filters, a GBS procedure was established that produces high call rates per marker (&gt;85%) with accuracy exceeding 99.4%. Furthermore, by capitalizing on the sequence-read structure of GBS data (stacks of reads), a new tool for resolving local haplotypes and scoring phased genotypes was developed, a feature that is not available in many GBS pipelines. Using local haplotypes reduces the marker dimensionality of the genotype matrix while increasing the informativeness of the data. Phased GBS in maize also revealed the existence of reproducibly inaccurate (apparent accuracy) genotypes that were due to divergent copy number variants (CNVs) unobservable in the underlying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.</p>

Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), which is linked to the bacterial <em>Candidatus</em> pathogen '<em>Ca.</em> Liberibacter asiaticus' (Las), is the most devastating disease of citrus plants, and longer-term control measures via breeding or genetic engineering have been unwieldy because all cultivated citrus species are susceptible to the disease. However, the degree of susceptibility varies among citrus species, which has prompted efforts to identify potential Las resistance/tolerance-related genes in citrus plants for application in breeding or genetic engineering programs. Plant exposure to one form of stress has been shown to serendipitously induce innate resistance to other forms of stress and a recent study showed that continuous heat treatment (40 to 42 °C) reduced Las titer and HLB-associated symptoms in citrus seedlings. The goal of the present study was to apply comparative proteomics analysis via 2-DE and mass spectrometry to elucidate the molecular processes associated with heat-induced mitigation of HLB in citrus plants. Healthy or Las-infected citrus grapefruit plants were exposed to room temperature or to continuous heat treatment of 40 °C for 6 days.</p>
<p>Results<br />
An exhaustive total protein extraction process facilitated the identification of 107 differentially-expressed proteins in response to Las and/or heat treatment, which included a strong up-regulation of chaperones including small (23.6, 18.5 and 17.9 kDa) heat shock proteins, a HSP70-like protein and a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO)-binding 60 kDa chaperonin, particularly in response to heat treatment. Other proteins that were generally down-regulated due to Las infection but up-regulated in response to heat treatment include RuBisCO activase, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, glucosidase II beta subunit-like protein, a putative lipoxygenase protein, a ferritin-like protein, and a glutathione S-transferase.</p>
<p>Conclusions<br />
The differentially-expressed proteins identified in this study highlights a premier characterization of the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the reversal of Las-induced pathogenicity processes in citrus plants and are hence proposed targets for application towards the development of cisgenic Las-resistant/tolerant citrus plants.</p>

This is the first comprehensive report of bacterial flora associated with the horn fly using a culture-independent method. Several rumen, environmental, symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria associated with the horn fly were identified and quantified. This is the first report of the presence of Wolbachia in horn flies of USA origin and is the first report of the presence of Rikenella in an obligatory blood feeding insect.</p>
<p>Adult horn flies were collected on a single date from pastured cattle at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, St. Gabriel Research Station using aerial nets. Within 1 h after collection the flies were transferred to large sterile Erlenmeyer flasks and maintained in total darkness for 1.5 h and 30°C to allow flies to oviposit on the flask bottom [73]. Adult flies were released from the flasks into a cage and eggs were collected by rinsing with distilled water onto a filter paper. Both the eggs and adult flies were frozen at −80°C. To preserve nucleic acid integrity, adults were sexed on dry ice prior to freezing. Each sample used for DNA extraction and pyrosequencing consisted of 5 adult males, 5 adult females or 50 eggs pooled together and homogenized. Three replicates of adult male, adult female and eggs were analyzed.</p>
<p>The horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is one of the most economically important pests of cattle. Insecticides have been a major element of horn fly management programs. Growing concerns with insecticide resistance, insecticide residues on farm products, and non-availability of new generation insecticides, are serious issues for the livestock industry. Alternative horn fly control methods offer the promise to decrease the use of insecticides and reduce the amount of insecticide residues on livestock products and give an impetus to the organic livestock farming segment. The horn fly, an obligatory blood feeder, requires the help of microflora to supply additional nutrients and metabolize the blood meal. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing methodologies enable researchers to examine the microflora diversity independent of culture methods.</p>

The metrics of range size and local abundance reflect aspects of the biology and ecology of a given species, and together with its per capita (or per unit area) effects on other members of the community comprise a well-accepted theoretical paradigm describing invasive species. Although these metrics are readily calculated from vegetation monitoring data, they have not generally (and effect in particular) been applied to native species. We describe how metrics defining invasions may be more broadly applied to both native and invasive species in vegetation management, supporting their relevance to local scales of species conservation and management. We then use a sample monitoring dataset to compare range size, local abundance and effect as well as summary calculations of landscape penetration (range size × local abundance) and impact (landscape penetration × effect) for native and invasive species in the mixed-grass plant community of western North Dakota, USA. This paper uses these summary statistics to quantify the impact for 13 of 56 commonly encountered species, with statistical support for effects of 6 of the 13 species. Our results agree with knowledge of invasion severity and natural history of native species in the region. We contend that when managers are using invasion metrics in monitoring, extending them to common native species is biologically and ecologically informative, with little additional investment.</p>

Data were generated on approximately 200 individual insects per cohort with 2-5 cohorts per year for a total of 44 cohorts between 1997 and 2010. Data provide the marginal, stage-specific rates of mortality for eggs, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th instar nymphs.  Mortality is characterized as caused by inviability (eggs only), dislodgement, predation, parasitism and unknown. Detailed methods can be found in Naranjo and Ellsworth 2005 (<em>Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata</em> 116(2): 93-108).  The method takes advantage of the sessile nature of immature stages of this insect. Briefly, an observer follows individual eggs or settled first instar nymphs from natural populations on the underside of cotton leaves in the field with a hand lens and determines causes of death for each individual over time.  Approximately 200 individual eggs and nymphs are observed for each cohort. Separately, densities of eggs and nymphs are monitored with standard methods (Naranjo and Flint 1994, <em>Environmental Entomology</em> 23: 254-266; Naranjo and Flint 1995, <em>Environmental Entomology</em> 24: 261-270) on a weekly basis.</p>

Once carbonate, amorphous Fe-oxide, organic, and residual Se fractions were factored into the analysis, the relationship decreased.

Expansive stands of <em>A. donax</em> have significant negative impacts on available water resources and efforts are underway to identify biological control agents against this species. The giant reed grows under adverse environmental conditions, displaying insensitivity to drought stress, flooding, heavy metals, salinity and herbaceous competition, thus hampering control programs. To establish a foundational molecular dataset, we used an llumina Hi-Seq protocol to sequence the transcriptome of actively growing shoots from an invasive genotype collected along the Rio Grande River, bordering Texas and Mexico. We report the assembly of 27,491 high confidence transcripts (≥200 bp) with at least 70% coverage of known genes in other Poaceae species. Of these 13,080 (47.58%), 6165 (22.43%) and 8246 (30.0%) transcripts have sequence similarity to known, domain-containing and conserved hypothetical proteins, respectively. We also report 75,590 low confidence transcripts supported by both trans-ABBySS and Velvet-Oases <em>de novo</em> assembly pipelines. Within the low confidence subset of transcripts we identified partial hits to known (19,021; 25.16%), domain-containing (7093; 9.38%) and conserved hypothetical (16,647; 22.02%) proteins. Additionally 32,829 (43.43%) transcripts encode putative hypothetical proteins unique to A. donax. Functional annotation resulted in 5,550 and 6,070 transcripts with assigned Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway information, respectively. The most abundant KEGG pathways are spliceosome, ribosome, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, plant–pathogen interaction, RNA degradation and oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway. Furthermore, we also found 12, 9, and 4 transcripts annotated as stress-related, heat stress, and water stress proteins, respectively. It is envisaged that these resources will promote and facilitate studies of the abiotic stress capabilities of this exotic plant species, which facilitates its invasive capacity.

Five factors explained 67% of the variance in the correlation matrix among Southern Regional Performance Nursery (SRPN) locations. The analysis divided the SRPN into four major Great Plains production zones, designated Southeast, Northwest, Southwest and Northeast. The remaining minor production zone consisted of only two central South Dakota locations, both outside the typical target area and selection site of SRPN entries. In the Northern Regional Performance Nursery (NRPN), five production zones were established, with location separation predominantly resulting from east–west differences in performance. The SRPN and NRPN wheat production zones closely follow previously described ecological zones of adaptation of native Great Plains plant species.

The female lays eggs in open wounds or orifices of warm-blooded animals. Upon hatching, the resulting larvae feed upon the host's living tissues, which can become infected and death can occur. The sterile insect technique was developed to eradicate this pest from North America and new female conditional-lethal strains that generate only male individuals are being developed for use in the eradication program. To facilitate the identification of useful transcripts and gene promoters for these new strains, an Illumina Hi-Seq protocol was used  to sequence the testes transcriptome of NWS. This study reports the assembly of 4149 transcripts (≥200 nt) from testes dissected from NWS males obtained from the J06 strain used in the screwworm production plant in Pacora, Panama. Functional annotation resulted in 2060, 2031, 558, and 325 transcripts with assigned BlastX, Gene Ontology, Enzyme Codes, and KEGG pathway information, respectively. In the Gene Ontology annotations, 6% and 3% of the transcripts in the Biological Process Ontology were noted as Developmental Process and Reproduction, respectively. Supplementary data includes FastA sequences of the final assembled dataset contigs and a table of Functional annotation information for the NWS testes transcripts.

<p>The small hive beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida, is a major pest of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in the United States and Australia, and an emergent threat in Europe. While strong honey bee colonies generally keep SHB populations in check, weak or stressed colonies can succumb to infestations. This parasite has spread from a sub-Saharan Africa to three continents, leading to immense management and regulatory costs. We performed a transcriptomic analysis involving deep sequencing of multiple life stages and both sexes of this species. The assembled transcriptome appears to be nearly complete, as judged by conserved insect orthologs and the ability to find plausible homologs for 11,952 proteins described from the genome of the red flour beetle. Expressed genes include each of the major metabolic, developmental and sensory groups, along with genes for proteins involved with immune defenses and insecticide resistance. We also present a total of 23,085 high-quality SNP's for the assembled contigs. We highlight potential differences between this beetle and its honey bee hosts, and suggest mechanisms of future research into the biology and control of this species. SNP resources will allow functional genetic analyses and analyses of dispersal for this invasive pest.</p>

The relative sensitivities of low streamflow to precipitation and temperature changes have important implications for adaptation planning because global circulation models produce relatively robust estimates of air temperature changes but have large uncertainties in projected precipitation amounts in the Pacific Northwest U.S. Quantile regression analyses indicate that low streamflow extremes from the majority of catchments in this study have declined from 1948 to 2013, which may significantly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and water resource management. Trends in the 25th percentile of mean annual streamflow have declined and the center of timing has occurred earlier. We quantify the relative influences of total precipitation and air temperature on the annual low streamflow extremes from 42 stream gauges using mean annual streamflow as a proxy for precipitation amount effects and streamflow center of timing as a proxy for temperature effects on low flow metrics, including 7q10 summer (the minimum 7 day flow during summer with a 10 year return period), mean August, mean September, mean summer, 7q10 winter, and mean winter flow metrics. These methods have the benefit of using only readily available streamflow data, which makes our results robust against systematic errors in high elevation distributed precipitation data. Winter low flow metrics are weakly tied to both mean annual streamflow and center of timing.</p>

We found large differences in genome size and karyotype between Aphelinus species, which is surprising given the similarity in their morphology and life history. Genome sizes estimated from flow cytometry were larger for species in the mali complex than those for the species in the daucicola and varipes complexes. Haploid karyotypes of the daucicola and mali complexes comprised five metacentric chromosomes of similar size, whereas those of the varipes complex had four chromosomes, including a larger and a smaller metacentric chromosome and two small acrocentric chromosomes or a large metacentric and three smaller acrocentric chromosomes. Total lengths of female haploid chromosome sets correlated with genome sizes estimated from flow cytometry. Phylogenetic analysis of karyotypic variation revealed a chromosomal fusion together with pericentric inversions in the common ancestor of the varipes complex and further pericentric inversions in the clade comprising Aphelinus kurdjumovi and Aphelinus hordei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 28S ribosomal DNA probe revealed a single site on chromosomes of the haploid karyotype of Aphelinus coreae. The differences in genome size and total chromosome length between species complexes matched the phylogenetic divergence between them.</p>
<p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong></p>
<p><strong>Specimens</strong><br />
The parasitoid species studied and the sources of the colonies are listed in the data file ""<a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/data-variation-genome-size-and-karyotype-among-closely-related-aphid-parasitoids-0"">Aphelinus_species_studied.csv</a>"". These colonies were reared on aphids at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, in Newark, Delaware, USA. Females of the yellow-white strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1830) (stock number 1495, obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University, <a href=""http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu"">http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu</a>) were used as internal controls for flow cytometry. All institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.</p>
<p><strong>Flow cytometry</strong><br />
Live Aphelinus were sexed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. To estimate genome sizes, we used the flow cytometry protocol described by Hanrahan and Johnston (2011) and Hare and Johnston (2011). We dissected heads from both males and females of the Aphelinus species in cold Galbraith buffer (Galbraith et al. 1983). Heads of female D. melanogaster were used as internal standards (1C = 175 Mb or 0.17 pg). To release the nuclei from cells, 15 female Aphelinus heads and one female Drosophila head, were ground together in one milliliter of cold Galbraith buffer using 15 strokes of the ""A"" pestle in a 2-ml Kontes Dounce tissue grinder. Three to six replicates were done for females and males of each species, but because male genome sizes were too close to that of Drosophila, we used heads from females of the same parasitoid species as internal standards for males. The samples were passed through a 35 micron filter and then stained with 40 parts per million of propidium iodide in the dark for 3-5 hours at 4°C. Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer with laser excitation at 488 nm. Red fluorescence from the propidium iodide was detected using an FL2 filter. The haploid content of DNA in megabases (Mb) was calculated for each Aphelinus sample from the ratio of mean fluorescence of the sample to mean fluorescence of the standard times the genome size of the standard. We report genome size estimates in megabases, but also give estimates in picograms (pg) calculated by dividing the amount of DNA in Mb by the standard 1C value of 978 Mb.</p>
<p><strong>Karyotypes</strong><br />
Chromosome preparations were made from cerebral ganglia of prepupae using a modified version of the technique in Imai et al. (1988). Wasps were dissected in 0.5% hypotonic sodium citrate solution containing 0.005% colchicine, and the tissues were incubated in fresh solution for ~30 minutes at room temperature. The material was transferred to a pre-cleaned microscope slide using a Pasteur pipette and gently flushed with Fixative I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol: distilled water 3:3:4). Tissues were disrupted in an additional drop of Fixative I using dissecting needles. Another drop of Fixative II (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol 1:1) was then applied to the center of the area and blotted off the edges of the slide. The slide was air dried for ~30 minutes at room temperature. For conventional staining, preparations were stained with freshly prepared 3% Giemsa solution in 0.05M Sørensen's phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4 + KH2PO4, pH 6.8). Mitotic divisions were studied and photographed using an optic microscope Zeiss Axioskop 40 FL fitted with a digital camera AxioCam MRc (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To obtain karyograms, the resulting images were processed with image analysis programs: Zeiss AxioVision version 3.1 and Adobe Photoshop version 8.0. Mitotic chromosomes were measured for 5-19 cells in 1-4 wasps per species using Adobe Photoshop. We report total length of all chromosomes in each karyotype; for diploid sets, we divided total length by two to make the values comparable to haploid sets. We also report relative lengths (RL; 100 x length of each chromosome divided by total length of the set) and centromeric indices (CI; 100 x length of shorter arm divided by total length of a chromosome). Chromosomes were classified into metacentric (M) or acrocentric (A) according to the guidelines in Levan et al. (1964).</p>

A multi‐year plot‐scale study was conducted on an eroded claypan soil with the following objectives: (1) assess the effects of buffer width, vegetation, and season on runoff transport of atrazine (ATR), metolachlor (MET), and glyphosate; (2) develop VBS design criteria for herbicides; and (3) compare differences in soil quality among vegetation treatments. Rainfall simulation was used to create uniform antecedent soil water content and to generate runoff. Vegetation treatment and buffer width impacted herbicide loads much more than season. Grass treatments reduced herbicide loads by 19‐28% and sediment loads by 67% compared to the control. Grass treatments increased retention of dissolved‐phase herbicides by both infiltration and adsorption, but adsorption accounted for the greatest proportion of retained herbicide load. This latter finding indicated VBS can be effective on poorly drained soils or when the source to buffer area ratio is high. Grass treatments modestly improved surface soil quality 8‐13 years after establishment, with significant increases in organic C, total N, and ATR and MET sorption compared to continuously tilled control. Herbicide loads as a function of buffer width were well described by first‐order decay models which indicated VBS can provide significant load reductions under anticipated field conditions.</p>

These breeding lines, derived from 109 PIC populations specifically developed to combine abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, showed superior agronomic potential compared with checks and local landraces. The diversity, scale, and potential of the material in the PIC breeding pipeline is invaluable and requires continued support to ensure the release of varieties that promise to increase the productivity of common bean in the E. African region.</p>

<p>In Flat Mites of the World Edition 2, you will find interactive keys, fact sheets, descriptions, and images to aid in the identification of flat mites (Acari: Trombidiformes: Tetranychoidea: Tenuipalpidae) from the United States and around the world. Please note that this tool is a work in progress! The newest edition of the tool, updated as of May 2013, will help identify the 38 genera of flat mites present throughout the world, including specific diagnostics for 20 species of Raoiella, 19 species of Brevipalpus, 3 species of Cenopalpus, Dolichotetranychus floridanus, Tenuipalpus pacificus, T. crassulus, and a closely related new species T. nr crassulus. The genus Raoiella is of major concern to quarantine world-wide due to the rapid spread of one species, the red palm mite (RPM), R. indica Hirst. The genus Brevipalpus is the most commonly intercepted genus of Tenuipalpidae in quarantine world-wide, but it is also the most complicated and by far the most diverse genus in the family. The three most important species in the family world-wide, Brevipalpus californicus, B. obovatus and B. phoenicis, though still consistently confused and misidentified, can be identified using this tool, and the Brevipalpus phoenicis species complex has been further separated into seven cryptic species. Dolichotetranychus is increasingly diverse genus of monocot-associated flat mites. Here we present diagnostics for an economically important species associated with pineapple across the world, D. floridanus. Tenuipalpus is a hugely diverse and complicated genus. Tenuipalpus pacificus is the name most commonly applied, correctly or incorrectly, to species in the genus Tenuipalpus intercepted on orchids across the world. We provide diagnostics for T. pacificus, based on type material. A recent incursion in the USA of an unidentified Tenuipalpus mite near T. crassulus sparked our interest in providing diagnostics for these two flat mite species associated with succulent plants.</p>
<p>Exotic species of flat mite pose a significant threat to USA’s biosecurity both as plant pests and as vectors of plant disease; however, the available diagnostics do not allow accurate and reliable identification of species. This tool is aimed at enhancing our diagnostic capabilities for key taxa and to ultimately allow plant protection and quarantine services to develop rapid solutions to serious biosecurity threats. The necessity to accurately and efficiently identify intercepted flat mites will increase as globalization increases. Flat Mites of the World provides a portal to a variety of keys, images, and fact sheets to help support identification of this diverse, potentially destructive group of mites.</p>
<p>This tool is designed to help identify any flat mite to the taxonomic level of genus, and in some cases to species, without the need for expertise in the group. Target users include USDA-APHIS pest survey specialists, ports of entry inspectors, other inspection personnel, students, and scientists. The “Is it a flat mite?” page provides information on how to distinguish a flat mite from other members of the spider mite superfamily Tetranychoidea.</p>
<p><strong>Slide mounted mites:</strong> A flat mite looks very different alive under a stereoscope compared to after it has been squashed flat and slide mounted. Often the 3D shape of the mite is lost in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Microscopy for mites:</strong> When dealing with mites, we are interested mainly in the morphology of surface structures, and DIC offers better interpretation of these features than phase contrast does.</p>
<p>The key is designed for users with limited knowledge about the group to identify flat mites to genus (and to identify critical genera to species). All characters are best observed using DIC (differential interference contrast) on a compound microscope. Ideally the user should have access to a compound microscope with a magnification capacity of 1000X (10X eyepiece + 100X oil objective) with DIC. The microscope images provided in the key were taken using DIC, mostly at 1000X. We highly recommend the use of DIC over Phase Contrast for identifying mites as the optical properties of DIC allow a more accurate interpretation of mite morphology. Please see the “DIC VS Phase Contrast” page for more information.</p>

Some boxwood diseases are deadly and quickly kill the infected plants, but with others, the plant can survive and even thrive when infected.  The fungus that causes volutella blight is the most common of these weak boxwood pathogens.  Even the healthiest boxwood plants are infected  by the volutella fungus, and often there are no signs that the plants are hurt by the infection. In order to understand why the volutella blight fungus is such a weak pathogen and to understand the genetic mechanisms it uses to interact with boxwood, the complete genome of the volutella fungus was sequenced and characterized.  These datasets are generated from the genome sequence of <em>Pseudonectria foliicola</em>, strain  ATCC13545, the fungus responsible for volutella disease of boxwood.  Datasets include the nuclear genome and mitochondrial genome assemblies (sequenced using Illumina technology), the predicted gene model dataset generated using MAKER, the multiple sequence alignment of single-copy orthologs used for phylogenetic analysis, CMAP files generated from SimpleSynteny analysis of mitogenomes, and high quality photographic images.</p>

<p>Boxwood blight emerged for the first time in the U.K. during the 1990s, then spread rapidly throughout Europe. By 2011, the fungus that causes the disease, <em>Calonectria pseudonaviculata</em>, was found in the U.S., threatening an industry valued at $103 million annually and countless mature landscapes, some dating back to early Colonial times.  Since the first U.S. outbreaks, boxwood blight has been identified from a total of 19 states that together comprise 62% of the total U.S. boxwood production.  A second pathogen, <em>C. henricotiae</em>, was recently described from five European countries. Infection can be latent, and the pathogen may sequester in less susceptible boxwood cultivars.  Because there are no curative treatments—fungicides are at best suppressive of symptoms—infected plants are rendered unfit for sale.  If infected plants are not destroyed, they provide a long-lived source of inoculum that spreads the pathogen by spores or resistant survival structures in soil, air, or water.  Our goal is to provide knowledge and tools needed to reduce the impact of boxwood blight on the green industry.</p>

<p>             Atrazine concentrations in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) were shown to be among the very highest of any watershed in the United States based on comparisons using the national Watershed Regressions for Pesticides (WARP) model and by direct comparison with the 112 watersheds used in the development of WARP. The herbicide data collected in GCEW are documented at plot, field, and watershed scales. This 20-yr-long (1991-2010) effort was augmented with a spatially broad effort within the Central Mississippi River Basin encompassing 12 related claypan watersheds in the Salt River Basin, two cave streams on the fringe of the Central Claypan Areas in the Bonne Femme watershed, and 95 streams in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The research effort on herbicide transport has highlighted the importance of restrictive soil layers with smectitic mineralogy to the risk of transport vulnerability. Near-surface soil features, such as claypans and argillic horizons, result in greater herbicide transport than soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivities and low smectitic clay content.</p>

46e63ebb-e8f9-490f-bba7-c793eb56729c,public,"{""hasEmail"": ""mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"", ""fn"": ""HoloBee database team, Jay Evans, Anna Childers""}","[""005:037""]","<p>Organisms living in honey bees and honey bee colonies form large associative holobiont communities that are integral to bee biology.  High-throughput sequencing approaches to characterize these holobiont communities from honey bees in various states of health and disease are now commonplace, producing large amounts of nucleotide sequence data that must be accurately and consistently analyzed in order to produce reliable and comparable reports.  In addition, new species designations and revisions are actively being made from honey bee holobiont communities, complicating nomenclature in larger databases where taxonomic descriptions associated with archived sequences can quickly become outdated and misleading.</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy and consistency of honey bee holobiont research, we have developed HoloBee: a curated database of publicly accessioned nucleotide sequences from the honey bee holobiont community.  Except in rare and noted exceptions made by curators, sequences used in HoloBee were obtained from, or in association with, <em>Apis mellifera</em> (Western honey bee) as well as other honey bee species where available (e.g. <em>Apis cerana</em>, <em>Apis dorsata</em>, <em>Apis laboriosa</em>, <em>Apis koschevnikovi</em>, <em>Apis florea</em>, <em>Apis andreniformis</em> and <em>Apis nigrocincta</em>).  Sources include:  within or on the surface of honey bees (adult, pupae, larvae, egg), corbicular pollen, bee bread, royal jelly, honey, comb, hive surfaces (e.g. bottom board debris, frames, landing platforms), and isolates of microbes, parasites and pathogens from honey bees.  HoloBee contains two non-overlapping sets of sequence data, HoloBee-Barcode and HoloBee-Mop, each of which have distinct intended uses.</p>
<p><strong>HoloBee-Barcode</strong> is a non-redundant database of taxonomically informative barcoding loci for all viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoans and metazoans associated with honey bees (<em>Apis</em> spp.).  It was created from an exhaustive master sequence archive of all valid holobiont sequences.  Redundancy was removed from this master archive using a clustering algorithm that grouped sequences with ≥ 99% identity and retained the longest sequence from each cluster as the representative accession for that sequence type (“centroid”).  These centroid sequences were concatenated into a fasta formatted file to create the HoloBee-Barcode database.  Associated taxonomy for each centroid, including Superkingdom through Species and Strain/Isolate, was individually reviewed and corrected when necessary by a curator.  Cross reference tables (separated according to 5 major taxonomic groups) provide a user-friendly outline of information for each centroid accession within HoloBee-Barcode including taxonomy, gene/product name, sequence length, the unaltered NCBI definition line, the number and identity of redundant sequences clustered within each centroid, and any additional information provided by the curator.  HoloBee-Barcode centroid counts are: Viruses = 86; Bacteria = 496; Fungi = 41; Protozoa = 4; Metazoa = 60.</p>
<p>HoloBee-Barcode is intended to improve and standardize quantitative and qualitative metagenomic descriptions of holobiont communities associated with honey bees by providing a curated set of barcode sequences.  The goal of genetic barcoding is to associate a nucleotide sequence sample to a taxonomically valid species.  Genomic regions targeted for such barcoding purposes varied by taxonomic group.  The small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA, or 16S rRNA, is the most commonly used barcode for bacteria and is used in HB-Barcode.  These 16S rRNA sequences will support the analysis of data generated with the widely used approach of amplicon-based 16S rRNA deep sequencing to study microbiota communities.  Although barcode markers for fungi are less definitive than bacteria, HB-Barcode defaults to the ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), which typically includes ITS-1, 5.8S, and ITS-2.  For some clades that cannot be resolved by this region, other barcode markers were selected.  The majority of barcodes for metazoan taxa are the mitochondrial locus cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI).  Complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence for <em>Apis cerana</em> (Asian honey bee) and <em>Galleria mellonella</em> (Greater wax moth) are included as barcodes for these species.  We note that <em>A. cerana</em> mtDNA is included because it is considered a potentially invasive honey bee species and monitoring for its occurrence is in practice regionally, including in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.  Protozoan barcodes include cytochrome b oxidase (Cytb), SSU, or ITS while entire genomes are used for viral barcoding.</p>
<p><strong>HoloBee-Mop</strong> is a database comprised mostly of chromosomal, mitochondrial and plasmid genome assemblies in order to aggregate as much honey bee holobiont genomic sequence information as possible.  For a few organisms without genome assembly data, transcriptome data are included (e.g. <em>Aethina tumida</em>, small hive beetle).  Unlike HoloBee-Barcode, redundancy removal was not performed on the HoloBee-Mop database and thus this resource provides an archive of nucleotide sequence assemblies from honey bee holobionts.  However, since full viral genomes are used in HoloBee-Barcode, only redundant viral sequences occur in HoloBee-Mop.  All accessions within each of these assemblies were concatenated into a single fasta formatted file to create the HoloBee-Mop database.  The intended purpose of HoloBee-Mop is to improve honey bee genome and transcriptome assemblies by “mopping-up” as much viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan and non-honey bee metazoan sequence data as possible.  Therefore, sequence data remaining after processing reads through both HoloBee-Barcode and HoloBee-Mop that do not map to the honey bee genome may contain unique data from taxonomic variants or novel species.  Details for each sequence assembly within HoloBee-Mop are tabulated in cross reference tables according to each major taxonomic group.  HoloBee-Mop assembly counts are: Viruses = 2; Bacteria = 55; Fungi = 5; Protozoa = 1; Metazoa = 6.</p>

Alan""}","[""005:037""]","<p>The need for a research tool that integrates the many physical and biological processes on a farm has led to the development of the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). The model has been used to evaluate a wide variety of technologies and management strategies, and these analyses have been reported in the scientific and farm-trade literature. Systems research in dairy and beef production remains as the primary purpose of this tool, but the model also provides an effective teaching aid. With the model, students gain a better appreciation for the complexity of livestock forage systems. The learn how small changes affect many parts of the system, causing unanticipated results. They may also use the model to develop a more optimum food production system. When used in extension type teaching, producers can learn more about their farms and obtain information useful in strategic planning. By testing and comparing different options with the model, those offering the greatest economic benefit with acceptable environmental impact can be found.</p>
<p>Input information is supplied to the program through three parameter files. The farm parameter file contains data describing the farm such as crop areas, soil type, equipment and structures used, numbers of animals at various ages, harvest, tillage, and manure handling strategies, and prices for various farm inputs and outputs. The machinery file includes parameters for each machine available for use on a simulated farm.</p>
<p>Simulation output is available in four files, which contain summary tables, report tables, optional tables, and parameter tables. The summary tables provide average performance, environmental impact, costs, and returns for the years simulated. These values consist of crop yields, feeds produced, feeds bought and sold, manure produced, nutrient losses to the environment, production costs, income from products sold, and the net return or profitability of the farm. Values are provided for the average and standard deviation of each over all simulated years. The report tables provide extensive output information including all the data given in the summary tables. In these tables, values are given for each simulated year of weather as well as the mean and variance over all simulated years. Optional tables are available for a closer inspection of how the components of the full simulation are functioning. These tables include very detailed data, often on a daily basis. Parameter tables summarize the input parameters specified for a given simulation. These tables provide a convenient method of documenting the parameter settings used for a simulation.</p>

a2023551-e1f2-4fed-8c48-3fba04292bf8,public,"{""hasEmail"": ""mailto:cynthia.parr@ars.usda.gov"", ""fn"": ""Parr, Cynthia""}","[""005:037""]","<p>United States agricultural researchers have many options for making their data available online. This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.</p>
<p>An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the <a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov"">Ag Data Commons</a>, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were to</p>
<ul>
<li>establish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals</li>
<li>compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms</li>
<li>determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data</li>
<li>ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish data</li>
</ul>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.</p>
<h3>Search methods</h3>
<p>We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of “agricultural data” /“ag data” / “scientific data” + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.</p>
<p>We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of “agriculture”, “ag data” and “university” to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University – International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis – Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.</p>
<p>Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.</p>
<p>Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.</p>
<p>We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>A summary of the major findings from our data review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors.</li>
<li>There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.</li>
<li>Not even one quarter of the domain-specific repositories and datasets reviewed allow open submission by any researcher regardless of funding or affiliation.</li>

The network effort was initiated in 2015 at this long-term, plot-scale research site. The camera at the research farm on focused a plot-scale, replicated research study that was established in 1997 to assess the long-term impacts of various tillage management options on soil organic carbon. Initially the study included eight tillage treatments: no-tillage, moldboard + disk tillage, chisel tillage, and fall and spring residue management, with or without strip-tillage and strip-tillage + sub-soiling. In 2004, the number of treatments were reduced to no-tillage, moldboard tillage, and fall and spring residue management without strip-tillage. All tillage treatments also had an early or late planting date. In 2008, the strip-tillage plots were modified to explore alternative strategies for supporting cellulosic bioenergy feedstock production, including planting of cellulosic feedstock.  The modification included adding perennials grasses into an extended 6-year rotation, winter cereal rye cover crops in a corn-soybean rotation, and an alternative Sorghum-Sudan grass hybrid forage system. Detailed soil and crop properties data have been collected from this site.

<p>Since its establishment in 1953, the SWRC in Tucson, Arizona, has collected, processed, managed, and disseminated high-resolution, spatially distributed hydrologic data in support of the center’s mission. Data management at the SWRC has evolved through time in response to new computing, storage, and data access technologies. In 1996, the SWRC initiated a multiyear project to upgrade rainfall and runoff sensors and convert analog systems to digital electronic systems supported by data loggers. This conversion was coupled with radio telemetry to remotely transmit recorded data to a central computer, thus greatly reducing operational overhead by reducing labor, maintenance, and data processing time. A concurrent effort was initiated to improve access to SWRC data by creating a system based on a relational database supporting access to the data via the Internet. An SWRC team made up of scientists, IT specialists, programmers, hydrologic technicians, and instrumentation specialists was formed. This effort is termed the Southwest Watershed Research Center Data Access Project (DAP).</p>
<p>The goal of the SWRC DAP is to efficiently disseminate data to researchers; land owners, users, and managers; and to the public. Primary access to the data is provided through a Web-based user interface. In addition, data can be accessed directly from within the SWRC network. The first priority for the DAP was to assimilate and make available rainfall and runoff data collected from two instrumented field sites, the WGEW near Tombstone, Arizona, and the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) south of Tucson, Arizona.</p>

<p>The Colorado potato beetle is considered the economically most significant defoliator of potato in northern latitudes worldwide. The range of this insect is continuing to expand, and it is likely to eventually colonize all potato-producing areas with temperate climate. Within it's native habitat, the beetle feeds on native solanaceous plants, <i>S. angustifolium, S. elaeagnifolium</i>, and buffalo bur, <i>S. rostratum</i>. However, it has adapted to potatoes and other solanaceous crops after its range expansion.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of any natural enemies that have been able to evolve seasonal adaptations, the cornerstone of Colorado potato beetle management has been the use of insecticides. However, the beetle has shown a remarkable ability to develop resistance to most insecticides used for its control. The mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance is yet unknown and genomic sequencing will lead to major advances in managing this pest in commercial plant production.</p>

Data consist of vertical line intercept measures of the perennial grasses, suffretescents and shrubs. Sixteen plots at each of 3 sites (Gravelly Ridges, Dona Ana exclosure, and Parker Tank) were established in 1938-39 by Ken Valentine. Plots were 21.3 x 21.3 m in 4 rows of 4 plots with a 7.6 m buffer zone. All plots were sampled before treatments. Plots were divided into east and west halves and 14 randomly located 10.65 m transects were located in each half plot. Vegetation (black grama, dropseeds, bush muhly, fluff grass, other grasses, creosotebush, honey mesquite, tarbush, mariola, and other shrubs) was measured using vertical line point intercepts. Plots have been re-read in 1947, 1956, 1960, 1967, 1989, 1995, and 2001 for Gravelly Ridges and 1939, 1947, 1960, 1967, and 2001 for Dona Ana and Parker Tank using the same methods. Treatments were applied factorially yielding a control plot, single factor plots, and plots with varying degrees of combinations of factors. The factors were lagomorph exclusion (using wire fencing), shrub removal (hand grubbing at the ground surface), furrowing (shallow, hand raked furrows to trap surface water), and seeding (broadcast applications of seeds of native perennials). Seeding and furrowing treatments were only applied in 1939. Lagomorph exclusion has persisted since establishment, and shrub removal treatments have been reapplied immediately following all years of vegetation sampling.</p>

The climate in these watersheds is subhumid, with average annual rainfall of 800 mm (1971-2000 average for Caddo County; Oklahoma Climatology Survey, 2005). The drainage area of the SGPRW is 2927 km2 and includes the LWREW. The LWREW covers an area of 610 km2 and consists of mixed agricultural land use, mainly pasture and rangeland that covers 68% of the total area. The topography is rolling with a maximum relief of 180 m and sandy to loamy soils. Of the 13 USGS stream gauges in the LWREW, two of them, ARS 522 and ARS 526, were initially managed by the USDA-ARS but decommissioned in 1985. Gauge ARS 522 was colocated with the USGS stream gauge ID 7327490, and data from this gauge were used when ARS 522 was discontinued. In 1992, the USGS installed the stream gauge ID 7327447 at the same location (Little Washita River near Cement, OK) where ARS 526 existed. For the stream gauges ID 522 and 526 installed by the ARS, stream stage data were obtained using a Hg manometer bubble gauge and a continuous stage recorder. Periodic stream discharge measurements were made during rain events and low-flow periods to define the relationship between flow discharge and stage. Discharge data by time increments were computed from the stage charts by the stage shift method (Corbett, 1943; Brakensiek et al., 1979). The directly measured data are the stage, which is then used to estimate discharge using stage-discharge relationships.  All measurements made at USGS gaging stations are quality assured and quality controlled.

Profiles of soil moisture and temperature are planned. Data are measured at 3-second intervals, and samples, averages, maxima, and minima are recorded on 5-minute intervals. On an hourly basis, data are telemetered to a server in a building on the research site.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit (PSWMRU) operates a precipitation gauge network on the WE-38 Experimental Watershed to support long-term intensive research on the impacts of agriculture on water quality in the northeast United States. The WE-38 Watershed is situated within the Northern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys Province and drains 7.3 km2 of mostly rolling farmland within the northern portion of the Mahantango Creek Watershed, a 420 km2 tributary to the Susquehanna River about 48 km north of Harrisburg in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. In 1966, scientists from the Northeast Watershed Research Center (NWRC) established an intensive rainfall monitoring network throughout Mahantango Creek Watershed, consisting of 43 rain gauges located to provide uniform aerial coverage and characterize the full range of elevations in Mahantango Creek Watershed. In 1996, the advent of data-logging and measurement technology made it possible to upgrade the existing network of Fischer-Porter rain gauges. The digital punch paper tape system (drive shaft and gears) and weighing mechanism on each Fischer-Porter gauge were replaced with an Interface (Model SSB-AJ-100) load cell and connected to a Campbell CR10X data logger. The load cell data-logging system, which is still in use today, records accumulated precipitation every 5 minutes to the nearest 0.254 mm.</p>

Initial funding for MANAGE was provided by USDA-ARS to support the USDA Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) and the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board as part of their mission to understand and mitigate agricultural impacts on water quality.</p>
<p>The original version of MANAGE, which drew heavily from an early 1980’s compilation of nutrient export data (Reckhow et al., 1980; Beaulac, 1980; Beaulac and Reckhow, 1982), created an electronic database with nutrient load data and corresponding site characteristics from 40 studies on agricultural (cultivated and pasture/range) land uses.  The first revision in 2008 added N and P load data from 15 additional studies along with N and P runoff concentration data for all 55 studies (Harmel et al., 2008).  Another revision in 2016 added 30 runoff studies from forested land uses, 91 drainage water quality studies from drained land, and 12 additional runoff studies from cultivated and pasture/range (Christianson and Harmel, 2015; Harmel et al., 2016).  In this expansion, fertilizer application timing, crop yield, and N and P uptake data were added to facilitate analysis of 4R Nutrient Stewardship.</p>
<p>With these updates, MANAGE contains data from a vast majority of published peer-reviewed N and P export studies on homogeneous cultivated, pasture/range, and forested land uses in the US under natural rainfall-runoff conditions, as well as artificially drained agricultural land.  Thus MANAGE facilitates expanded spatial analyses and improved understanding of regional differences, management practice effectiveness, and impacts of land use conversions and management techniques, and it provides valuable data for modeling and decision-making related to agricultural runoff.</p>

NALT is updated annually each January.  The subject scope of agriculture is broadly defined in the thesaurus, and includes terminology in the supporting biological, physical, and social sciences. Biological nomenclature comprises a majority of the terms in the thesaurus and is located in the ""Taxonomic Classification of Organisms"" Subject Category. Political geography is mainly described at the country level. Published since 2007, the Glossary is a collection of definitions of agricultural terms developed in conjunction with the creation of the NAL Agricultural Thesaurus. The 2018 edition of the glossary contains 5,618 terms ranging across agriculture and its many ancillary subjects. Most definitions were composed by the NAL Thesaurus Staff. Those definitions taken from government sources are indicated in the ""Definition Source"" field and are included in the bibliography. In 2010, the thesaurus was made available as Linked Open Data. Linked Open Data translates information into a form both readable and understandable by computers. This translation makes it possible for different information resources, such as Web pages, datasets and research articles, to be interconnected, creating meaningful relationships that make it easier to locate related content. In May 2007, Spanish language versions of its NAL Agricultural Thesaurus (NALT) and Glossary of Agricultural Terms were published under the Spanish language names ""Tesauro Agrícola"" and ""Glosario"". The Thesaurus and Glossary are produced cooperatively by the USDA National Agricultural Library and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), as well as other Latin American agricultural institutions belonging to the Agriculture Information and Documentation Service of the Americas (SIDALC).

NPP-associated percent cover measurements were developed for and are used solely to provide the best estimate of biomass production. Becuase the methodology results in measurements of overlapping subcanopy systems and canopies of adjacent individuals, NPP percent cover measurements are not an appropriate measure of actual aerial plant cover.

Analyses and results for ANPP differ from previous uses of the data from 1989-1998 (Huenneke et al., 2002) in three ways: (1) Yucca elata was removed prior to analysis because its growth form results in large errors in biomass estimates from year-to-year, (2) regressions between biomass and plant volume used an intercept equal to 0 to be consistent with a recent study in a similar system (Muldavin et al., 2008), and (3) reference harvests obtained in extreme years resulted in adjusted regression coefficents through time that reflect year-to-year variation in ANPP. These changes result in ANPP values that are smaller compared (Peters et al. submitted) with previous studies (Huenneke et al., 2002).</p>

<p>Best nutrient management practices are critical for maintaining profitable economic returns, sustaining higher yields, lowering environmental impacts, optimizing nutritional quality, and providing ecosystem services. Best management practices that improve nutrient use efficiencies can reduce nutrient losses from agricultural systems. However, we need to improve our understanding of biological, physical and chemical influences on nutrient processes. For instance, crop use efficiency of nitrogen (N), the primary macronutrient regulating yield and protein content, can be reduced by processes such as denitrification (N2O and N2 emission), leaching (NH4-N, NO3-N, and organic-N), ammonia (NH3-N,) volatilization, surface runoff and erosion, disease, and non-crop competition. Similarly, we need to obtain more information about biological and physical cycles of nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), including factors that influence nutrient availability from fertilizers, crop residues, cover crops, manures, and other byproducts. We need a better understanding of relationships between soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates, and availability and uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients.  In addition, we need information regarding how these practices impact yields, organoleptic qualities, and the macro- and micro-nutritional composition of plants.  This information will improve our ability to develop best nutrient management practices.</p>
<p>Optimal soil nutrient levels are critical for maximizing economic returns, increasing sustainable yields, lowering environmental impacts, sustaining ecosystem services and optimizing nutritional and organoleptic qualities of human and animal foods. Efficient management practices are crucial for increasing economic returns for land managers in a sustainable manner while producing high quality of food for animals and humans with reduced off-site transfer of nutrients from agricultural areas in watersheds. Optimizing N and P inputs requires more information about nutrient inputs from fertilizers, manures, composts, agricultural byproducts, cover crops, and other nutrient sources in addition to nutrient cycling within soils.  This requires data from long-term nutrient management studies across a wide range of soils, crops, and environmental conditions. Land management needs are to connect nutrient management practices for crops with nutrient use efficiency; crop quality; crop chemical composition and nutritional value, quality and acceptability for animal and human health.  Development of databases that enable the scientific exploration of connections among data generated from diverse research efforts such as nutrient management, fate and ecosystem service outcomes, nutritional composition of crops, and animal and human health, is needed.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is a key nutrient that enhances agricultural yield and protein content, but multiple N loss pathways, as previously mentioned, reduce crop N use efficiency (NUE). Implementing proper management practices is needed to reduce N losses from agricultural systems. ARS has multidisciplinary scientific teams with expertise in soils, ecological engineering, hydrology, livestock management and nutrition, horticulture, crop breeding, human and animal nutrition, post-harvest management and processing, and other areas, and intentional collaboration among these teams offers opportunities to rapidly improve NUE and crop quality and reduce off-site N losses.</p>
<p>Similarly, increased P use efficiencies are needed to enhance and ensure sustainable agricultural production and to reduce environmental degradation of water sources. Manure is a valuable source of P and it can be used as a soil amendment to reduce crop production costs. However, there is a need to improve our understanding of the biological and physical cycles of soil P, as well as to obtain more information about P supplies from fertilizer, crop residues, cover crops, manure, and byproducts, and livestock nutrition impacts on manure properties.</p>
<p>There is also a need for a better understanding of soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates and how their interactions with crops and community ecology affect yield and the uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients and the ultimate nutritional composition and organoleptic qualities of the crop. Studies documenting the responses of crop-associated biological communities to management practices and genetic technologies implemented across multiple environments (e.g., soil types and chemistries, hydrologic regimes, climates) will improve our understanding of gaps in macro- and micro-nutrient management strategies.</p>
<p>A goal of the USDA-ARS is to increase agricultural production and quality while reducing environmental impacts. The Nutrient Uptake and Outcomes (NUOnet) database will be able to help establish baselines on nutrient use efficiencies; processes contributing to nutrient losses; and processes contributing to optimal crop yield, nutritional and organoleptic quality. This national database could be used to calculate many different environmental indicators from a comprehensive understanding of nutrient stocks and flows. Increasing our understanding of stocks and flows could help in the identification of knowledge gaps as well as areas where increased efficiencies can be achieved at a national level. NUOnet could also be used to develop tools to derive cost-benefit curves associated with nutrient management improvement scenarios and assess local, regional and national impacts of off-site nutrient loss. Understanding how agricultural production impacts human health is a challenge, and the database could be used to link crop management strategies to crop chemical composition to human consumption patterns and ultimately to human health outcomes. A national database will also be very important for development and evaluation of new technologies such as real-time sensing or other proximal and remote sensing technologies that enable assessment of nutrient use efficiencies, particularly at the grower level. The database could also be used to develop analyses that will contribute to the recommendation of policies for resource allocations that will most effectively fulfill the goals of the Grand Challenge. Such a national database with contributions from peers across different national programs could also enhance collaborations between ARS, universities, and extension specialists, as well as with producers, industry, and other partners.</p>

Nitrogen fertilization is essential for optimizing crop yields; however, it increases N2O emissions. The study objective was to compare N2O emissions resulting from application of commercially available enhanced-effi ciency N fertilizers with emissions from conventional dry granular urea in irrigated cropping systems. These emissions were monitored from several irrigated cropping systems receiving N fertilizer rates ranging from 0-246 kg/ha from years 2007-2008 with intermediate rates of 157 kg/ha applied to the barley crop in corn-barley rotation and 56 kg/ha applied to the dry bens in the corn-dry bean rotation. Cropping systems included conventional-till continuous corn (CT-CC), no-till continuous corn (NT-CC), no-till corn–dry bean (NT-CDb), and no-till corn–barley (NT-CB). Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured during ten growing seasons using static, vented chambers and a gas chromatograph analyzer.  This work shows that the use of no-till and enhanced-effi ciency N fertilizers can potentially reduce N2O emissions from irrigated systems.</p>

<p>Phytophthora, an oomycete plant pathogen, is more closely related to brown algae and diatoms than true fungi and has been placed in a separate kingdom, the Stramenopiles (Gunderson et al., 1987;   Förster et al., 1990; Leipe et al., 1994). Due to their high virulence and ability to spread rapidly throughout the world, Phytophthora is one of the most important groups of plant pathogens. The destructive potential of Phytophthora diseases is well illustrated by late blight (P. infestans), which was responsible for the Irish potato famine and has again become globally problematic due to the introduction of new, fungicide-resistant lineages (Fry and Goodwin, 1997). Sudden oak death in the US (Rizzo et al., 2002) and diseases on ornamental plants in Europe (Werres et al., 2001), caused by P. ramorum, are examples of the threat to forest ecosystems and the nursery industry.</p>
<p>Toward the goal of enhancing our ability to detect, diagnose, monitor, and manage Phytophthora diseases, we have been systematically cataloging genotypic and phenotypic data of Phytophthora spp. in a web-based database that can be easily accessed and utilized by the global community of plant health professionals. Although we are currently focusing on the genotypic characterization of the isolates archived in the World Phytophthora Collection (WPC; Phytophthora.ucr.edu) at UC-Riverside and in the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA), we plan to include Phytophthora collections throughout the world in order to create a global atlas of the diversity and distribution of Phytophthora species. </p>

Preservation and management of semi-arid ecosystems requires understanding of the processes involved in soil erosion and their interaction with plant community. Rainfall simulations on natural plots provide an effective way of obtaining a large amount of erosion data under controlled conditions in a short period of time. This dataset contains hydrological (rainfall, runoff, flow velocity), erosion (sediment concentration and rate), vegetation (plant cover), and other supplementary information from 272 rainfall simulation experiments conducted on 23 rangeland locations in Arizona and Nevada between 2002 and 2013. The dataset advances our understanding of basic hydrological and biological processes that drive soil erosion on arid rangelands. It can be used to quantify runoff, infiltration, and erosion rates on a variety of ecological sites in the Southwestern USA. Inclusion of wildfire and brush treatment locations combined with long term observations makes it important for studying vegetation recovery, ecological transitions, and effect of management. It is also a valuable resource for erosion model parameterization and validation.</p>
<p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />
Rainfall was generated by a portable, computer-controlled, variable intensity simulator (Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator). The WGRS can deliver rainfall rates ranging between 13 and 178 mm/h with variability coefficient of 11% across 2 by 6.1 m area. Estimated kinetic energy of simulated rainfall was 204 kJ/ha/mm and drop size ranged from 0.288 to 7.2 mm. Detailed description and design of the simulator is available in Stone and Paige (2003). Prior to each field season the simulator was calibrated over a range of intensities using a set of 56 rain gages. During the experiments windbreaks were setup around the simulator to minimize the effect of wind on rain distribution. On some of the plots, in addition to rainfall only treatment, run-on flow was applied at the top edge of the plot. The purpose of run-on water application was to simulate hydrological processes that occur on longer slopes (&gt;6 m) where upper portion of the slope contributes runoff onto the lower portion.</p>
<p>Runoff rate from the plot was measured using a calibrated V-shaped supercritical flume equipped with depth gage. Overland flow velocity on the plots was measured using electrolyte and fluorescent dye solution. Dye moving from the application point at 3.2 m distance to the outlet was timed with stopwatch. Electrolyte transport in the flow was measured by resistivity sensors imbedded in edge of the outlet flume. Maximum flow velocity was defined as velocity of the leading edge of the solution and was determined from beginning of the electrolyte breakthrough curve and verified by visual observation (dye). Mean flow velocity was calculated using mean travel time obtained from the electrolyte solution breakthrough curve using moment equation.</p>
<p>Soil loss from the plots was determined from runoff samples collected during each run. Sampling interval was variable and aimed to represent rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph, any changes in runoff rate, and steady state conditions. This resulted in approximately 30 to 50 samples per simulation.</p>
<p>Shortly before every simulation plot surface and vegetative cover was measured at 400 point grid using a laser and line-point intercept procedure (Herrick et al., 2005). Vegetative cover was classified as forbs, grass, and shrub. Surface cover was characterized as rock, litter, plant basal area, and bare soil. These 4 metrics were further classified as protected (located under plant canopy) and unprotected (not covered by the canopy). In addition, plant canopy and basal area gaps were measured on the plots over three lengthwise and six crosswise transects.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental procedure</strong><br />
Four to eight 6.1 m by 2 m replicated rainfall simulation plots were established on each site. The plots were bound by sheet metal borders hammered into the ground on three sides. On the down slope side a collection trough was installed to channel runoff into the measuring flume. If a site was revisited, repeat simulations were always conducted on the same long term plots.</p>
<p>The experimental procedure was as follows. First, the plot was subjected to 45 min, 65 mm/h intensity simulated rainfall (dry run) intended to create initial saturated condition that could be replicated across all sites. This was followed by a 45 minute pause and a second simulation with varying intensity (wet run). During wet runs two modes of water application were used as: rainfall or run-on. Rainfall wet runs typically consisted of series of application rates (65, 100, 125, 150, and 180 mm/h) that were increased after runoff had reached steady state for at least five minutes. Runoff samples were collected on the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph and during each steady state (a minimum of 3 samples). Overland flow velocities were measured during each steady state as previously described. When used, run-on wet runs followed the same procedure as rainfall runs, except water application rates varied between 100 and 300 mm/h. In approximately 20% of simulation experiments the wet run was followed by another simulation (wet2 run) after a 45 min pause. Wet2 runs were similar to wet runs and also consisted of series of varying intensity rainfalls and/or run-on inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Resulting Data</strong><br />
The dataset contains hydrological, erosion, vegetation, and ecological data from 272 rainfall simulation experiments conducted on 12 sq. m plots at 23 rangeland locations in Arizona and Nevada. The experiments were conducted between 2002 and 2013, with some locations being revisited multiple times.</p>

The primary purpose for these lysimeters was to measure evapotranspiration (ET); these data describe changes in soil water during the snow-free season. In addition to measuring changes in total soil water, soil water content profiles and soil temperature profiles were measured within or adjacent to the lysimeters and are reported. Two pairs of soil lysimeters were installed in the RCEW in 1967, one pair at the Lower Sheep Creek climate station (designated the east and west lysimeters), separated, center to center, by 3.6 m, and the other pair at the Reynolds Mountain climate station (designated north and south), separated by 4.7 m. These lysimeters were hydraulic weighing lysimeters in which an inner cylindrical tank containing soil is set within a slightly larger outer cylinder. The inner cylinder rests on a coil of 0.05 m diameter butyl tubing filled with liquid (different low-freezing point liquids were used). The inner cylinder was 1.22 m deep and 1.47 m in diameter. The butyl tubing was hydraulically connected underground to a pressure transducer or manometer. The soil in each lysimeter was extracted from near the lysimeter sites. A soil core was taken by repeatedly excavating a soil cylinder of slightly larger diameter than the lysimeter and forcing the lysimeter sleeve over the soil to the depth of the sleeve (1.22 m). A metal plate was then forced across the cylinder bottom and welded to it in place. The inner cylinder, thus filled with soil, was then transported to the previously excavated outer cylinder via crane and set on the butyl tubing. A neutron probe access tube was installed in the center of each lysimeter to monitor soil water content changes with depth, and two 1.2 m ceramic suction ""candles"" were placed at the bottom of the lysimeters through a separate entrance. This operation resulted in an undisturbed soil monolith with extant vegetation in place. This is critical for two reasons: (1) Growing native vegetation under natural conditions is problematic in this environment, and plant development is slow. (2) The soil horizonation, particularly the argillic and calcic horizons which are both strongly embedded in coarse fragments, would be essentially impossible to reproduce artificially.</p>

Samples of suspended-sediment concentration were collected at Outlet, Tollgate, and Reynolds Mountain East gauging stations starting in the 1960s and continuing to the present. In early years, samples were collected manually during storm events using integrated samplers at the large weirs or simple grab samples at the smaller weirs.

In recent years, automated Sigma pump samplers have been used at all gauging stations to collect a continuous record of instantaneous point measures of suspended-sediment concentration during high and low flows.

Each site is located in close proximity to a climate station on nearly level slopes. In most sites, there were six or seven measurement depths ranging from 2.5 to 240 cm; in 1990, new sensors were installed at all sites at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and 180 cm. Each soil temperature depth profile is located near at least one neutron access tube and a precipitation gauge, and complete climate station information was collected either at the site or in reasonable proximity. Regular data collection started in 1981 or 1982, depending on the site. The temperature sensors used were YSI (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio) two-thermistor composite thermolinear components accurate to 0.15C. Data were originally collected in 1981 by connecting a hand-held voltmeter to the sensor leads, and individual sensors at different depths were read using a manual switch. These data were collected once each week, and the time was recorded. At some sites the switches were bypassed and hooked up to data loggers of various design resulting in more frequent (either 1 or 4 hour) recording intervals. Prior to 1990, soil temperature sensors were installed by attaching the sensors to a 0.05 m diameter wooden pole at the desired depth intervals, drilling a hole a with a drill rig (the soils in the RCEW are very rocky), inserting the pole in the drilled hole, and backfilling.</p>

Interpretation of new research using SNPs in the context of literature citing SSRs requires a common coordinate system. A new pipeline, using a stepwise relaxation of stringency, was used to map SSR primers onto the latest rice pseudomolecule assembly. The SSR markers and experimentally assayed amplicon sizes are presented in a relational database with a web-based front end, and are available as a track loaded in a genome browser with links connecting the browser and database.

The metadata parameters describe the station location and time at which the data were collected. The time of observation is reported both in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) Nominal and UTC actual time. Days begin at UTC hour 0100 and end at UTC hour 0000 the following day. The data parameters are valid for the reported times. Missing values are reported as 9's in the data field. Several data parameters have an associated Quality Control (QC) Flag Code which is assigned during the Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) quality control processing; data were never changed, only flagged. When not present in the raw data, the dewpoint is computed using the formula from Bolton (1980). Calculated Sea Level pressure is computed from station pressure, temperature, dewpoint, and station elevation using the formula of Wallace and Hobbs (1977).

This Sensible, Latent and Ground Heat Flux composite was formed from three data sources: the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART) Energy Balance/Bowen Ratio (EBBR) sites, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD) Little Washita Watershed site, and the ARM SGP Eddy Correlation (ECOR) sites. Data from 14 ARM/EBBR stations, 1 NOAA/ATDD station, and 8 ARM/ECOR stations were merged to form this composite. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) did not do any quality control on the data set. Heat flux sensors consist of a differential temperature sensor which measures heat flow. Heat flux is a vector quantity of energy flowing through a 1 meter square surface in one second. Sensible heat flux is the transfer of sensible heat between the surface and the air, or vice versa. Latent heat flux is the transfer of latent heat (heat released or absorbed by water) between the surface and the air, or vice versa. Ground, or soil, heat flux is the transfer of sensible heat in the soil, either toward the surface or away from the surface. The Little Washita site records only 1 soil heat flux value. The EBBR sites record soil heat flux values from 5 different sensors. The ARM soil sensors are located in a half-circle approximately 2 meters in diameter under the net radiometer, which extends to the south about 1 meter from the EBBR frame. The soil conditions at the EBBR sites are varied from very sandy soil to very clay-laden soil. However, all of the sensors for one particular EBBR site are in the same soil type. Information on the soil characteristics at each of the ARM Soil Water and Temperature System (SWATS) sites (which are located nearby the ARM EBBR sites) is available as part of the ARM/GCIP NESOB-97. (These include the ""Organic Carbon and Matter"", ""Soil Texture"", ""Parameters for Soil Water Retention Models"", ""Bulk Density"", Particle Size"", and ""Soil Water Retention"" data sets). The EBBR sites also record Bowen Ratio, home_15 and home_30 values, as well, whereas the Little Washita site does not. Since this is a composite data set, only the first 3 fields of data from the Little Washita site will have values, while the rest of the parameters on a line will always be missing.

This data set covers the period from 1 June through 31 July 1997. The SGP97 domain is approximately 97W to 99W longitude and 34.5N to 37N latitude. These data are in their original NetCDF format. The 50-MHz Radar Wind Profiler/RASS (RWP50) measures wind profiles from (nominally) 2 to 12 km and virtual temperature profiles from 2 to 4 km. It operates by transmitting electromagnetic energy into the atmosphere and measuring the strength and frequency of backscattered energy. Virtual temperatures are recovered by transmitting an acoustic signal vertically and measuring the electromagnetic energy scattered from the acoustic wavefront. The propagation speed of the acoustic wave is proportional to the square root of the virtual temperature. The primary quantities measured with the system are the intensity and Doppler frequency of backscattered radiation.

<p>Most investigators studying grasslands have assumed that the low standing biomass of the SGS created a system with a low probability of carrying fire, and thus a minimal historical role of fire. Nonetheless, there are years with aboveground biomass equivalent to the mixed grass prairie, and a high frequency of lightening storms. Regardless of the historical role of fire in SGS, there are new questions regarding its utility in managing for the presence of the threatened mountain plover, which only nests in areas of low plant biomass. United States Forest Service, Pawnee National Grassland recently initiated a burning program in the mid 1990s to address questions about using fire to increase plover habitat; we have collected data on some of these plots to investigate the influence of fire on SGS vegetation. Several datasets were created between 1999 and 2004 by SGS-LTER researchers, including measurements of shrub and cactus mortality rates, aboveground net primary production, amounts of litter and standing dead, and aboveground nitrogen dynamics in burned and control plots in the western section of the Pawnee National Grassland.

<p>The Breeding Bird Survey is a large-scale survey of North American birds. It is a roadside survey, primarily covering the continental United States and southern Canada, although survey routes have recently been initiated in Alaska and northern Mexico. The BBS was started in 1966, and the over 3,500 routes are surveyed in June by experienced birders. Routes 305, Nunn and 901, Rockport are located in the area of the SGS research site. The primary objective of the BBS has been the estimation of population change for songbirds. However, the data have many potential uses, and investigators have used the data to address a variety of research and management objectives. In the USGS-BBS Home Page, reults from the BBS are summarized, and pictures of birds and other species information. Data from 1966 - 2002 were managed by the SGS-LTER project.

<p>The importance of disturbance intensity and herbivory by cattle and white grubs, or the larvae of June beetles to recovery of shortgrass steppe ecosystems in Colorado, USA were evaluated over a 14 year time period. Disturbance intensity was defined by survival of the dominant grass species (Bouteloua gracilis) after an outbreak of root feeding activity by white grubs. 16 patches of vegetation consisting of four pairs of adjacent ungrazed-grazed by cattle locations with 2 replicates that were recently affected by white grubs were selected in 1977. Disturbance intensity was determined in 1977 by the area in each patch that contained live tillers of B. gracilis. Permanent plots were lcoated both within and outside of each patch. Plant basal cover and density by species were estimated at time of peak aboveground biomass in 6 different years on each plot. Successional dynamics on patches was similar to areas affected by other types of disturbances, however, rate of recovery was faster for patches affected by grubs. Grazing by cattle was infrequently important to plant recovery, a result similar to effects of grazing on other aspects of shortgrass steppe. Disturbance intensity was important to recovery of B. gracilis since tiller survival in 1977 was linearly related to cover in each year of sampling. For ungrazed patches, initial conditions were important to recovery of B. gracilis for as many as 14 years. For grazed patches, initial conditions decreased and grazing increased in importance through time. Changes in resource quality and more uniform distribution of roots due to grazing likely resulted in more complete mortality of plants by grubs under grazed compared to ungrazed conditions. Persistance of shortgrass steppe ecosystems in spite of disturbances with different intensities are determined at least in part by characteristics of disturbances interacting with the ability ofplants to respond, and in part by the evolutionary history of the system. Although white grubs affect shortgrass communities infrequently, they have large and important effects on plant community structure through time, and represent an important class of disturbance defined by intensity.</p>

<p>Our research on abandoned fields at the CPER has two aspects,vegetation recovery and soil recovery. We wish to monitor these fields for the tem of the LTER project (decades or centuries), and to address some specific research questions. Our questions are: 1. Does vegetation on shortgrass steppe recover 55 years following cultivation? Specifically, does Bouteloua gracilis, the dominant shortgrass steppe species, recover? Prior results indicated that B. gracilis reovers on some fields, and does not on others. The fields that do not are dominated by buffalo grass. In this new work at the CPER, we ask an additional question: 2. What determines whether B. gracilis recovers? 3. Does soil organic matter recover following abandonment? Specifically, do indices of soil fertility such as nitrogen availability recover? 4. Does small-scale patterning associated with individual plants recover following disturbance? 5. Does the rate of soil recovery depend upon the rate of vegetation recovery? Past results on the Pawnee National Grasslands indicated that only small amounts of organic matter had accumulated following abandonment but that nitrogen availability had recovered to its original levels under B. gracilis plants on the abandoned fields. Specifically, we are interested in whether it makes a difference to soils if blue grama recovers or not.

The initial sampling from 1970 to 1974 showed that the water and water plus nitrogen treatments had the strongest effect on plant community structure, both treatments increased biomass, and exotic weed species were noted on the water plus nitrogen treatment. Later sampling from 1982 to 1991 showed a ten-fold increase in exotic weed species on the water plus nitrogen plots as compared to the controls (Milchunas and Lauenroth 1995), a community change that has persisted on this site due to a chronic elevation of soil nitrogen caused by a plant tissue/soil organic matter feedback mechanism (Vinton and Burke 1995). In 1998, Six new treatments were superimposed on the historic study site. The six new treatments were: control, sugar, lignin, sawdust, lignin and sugar, and sawdust and sugar.In 2010, plots will be sampled every 5 years. Our objective in this study is to examine how plant communities change through time and explore implications of these changes for monitoring potentially stressed ecosystems.

<p>Carbon (C) sequestration potential in grasslands is thought to be high due to the large soil organic carbon pools characteristic of these ecosystems. Inputs of C (aboveground net primary productivity) are highly correlated to precipitation across the Great Plains region; however, changes in C pool size at a specific site are governed by the relative input and output rates across time. Our objective was to quantify the ecosystem C response of three grassland community types (shortgrass steppe, mixed grass and tallgrass prairie) to interannual variation in precipitation. At five sites across a precipitation gradient in the Great Plains, we measured net primary production (NPP), soil respiration (SRESP), and litter decomposition rates for three consecutive years. NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition increased from shortgrass steppe (175, 454, and 47 g C m-2 yr-1) to tallgrass prairie (408, 1221, and 348 g C m-2 yr-1 for NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition respectively). Increased growing season precipitation between study years resulted in increased NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition at almost all sites. However, the regional patterns of the interannual NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition responses differ from each other. This data suggests NPP and SRESP are more sensitive to interannual changes in precipitation than litter decomposition, and that shortgrass steppe sites are more responsive to interannual variability in precipitation than mixed grass and tallgrass prairie.</p>

<p>We investigated the use of prairie dog towns by cattle (Bos taurus) on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado by conducting surveys of cattle and vegetation from June to August 1999. Cattle presence and behavior were recorded 3 times a week during driving surveys of 15 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. A subset of 3 pastures with prairie dog towns was intensively surveyed twice weekly wherein the habitat and activity of a randomly chosen focal animal was recorded every 6 minutes for 3.5 hours. Bite and step counts of other individuals were recorded for 5-minute intervals. Vegetation height and cover data were collected monthly on each of 6 habitats. Results from driving surveys and intensively surveyed pastures were similar; cattle neither significantly preferred nor avoided prairie dog towns. Bare ground cover on prairie dog towns did not significantly differ from most other habitats, but vegetation on prairie dog towns was significantly shorter on (mean = 6.7 cm) than that off (mean = 11.9 cm) prairie dog towns. Nevertheless, foraging observations indicated that there was no significant difference between cattle foraging rates on swales (70.9 bites/min) and prairie dog towns (69.5 bites/min).

<p>We investigated the use of prairie dog towns by cattle (Bos taurus) on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado by conducting surveys of cattle and vegetation from June to August 1999. Cattle presence and behavior were recorded 3 times a week during driving surveys of 15 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. A subset of 3 pastures with prairie dog towns was intensively surveyed twice weekly wherein the habitat and activity of a randomly chosen focal animal was recorded every 6 minutes for 3.5 hours. Bite and step counts of other individuals were recorded for 5-minute intervals. Vegetation height and cover data were collected monthly on each of 6 habitats. Results from driving surveys and intensively surveyed pastures were similar; cattle neither significantly preferred nor avoided prairie dog towns. Bare ground cover on prairie dog towns did not significantly differ from most other habitats, but vegetation on prairie dog towns was significantly shorter on (mean = 6.7 cm) than that off (mean = 11.9 cm) prairie dog towns. Nevertheless, foraging observations indicated that there was no significant difference between cattle foraging rates on swales (70.9 bites/min) and prairie dog towns (69.5 bites/min). Thus, cattle on the shortgrass steppe appear to use prairie dog towns in proportion to their availability and, while there, they graze as intensively as they do on habitats not inhabited by prairie dogs.</p>

<p>Carbon (C) sequestration potential in grasslands is thought to be high due to the large soil organic carbon pools characteristic of these ecosystems. Inputs of C (aboveground net primary productivity) are highly correlated to precipitation across the Great Plains region; however, changes in C pool size at a specific site are governed by the relative input and output rates across time. Our objective was to quantify the ecosystem C response of three grassland community types (shortgrass steppe, mixed grass and tallgrass prairie) to interannual variation in precipitation. At five sites across a precipitation gradient in the Great Plains, we measured net primary production (NPP), soil respiration (SRESP), and litter decomposition rates for three consecutive years. NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition increased from shortgrass steppe (175, 454, and 47 g C m-2 yr-1) to tallgrass prairie (408, 1221, and 348 g C m-2 yr-1 for NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition respectively). Increased growing season precipitation between study years resulted in increased NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition at almost all sites. However, the regional patterns of the interannual NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition responses differ from each other. This data suggests NPP and SRESP are more sensitive to interannual changes in precipitation than litter decomposition, and that shortgrass steppe sites are more responsive to interannual variability in precipitation than mixed grass and tallgrass prairie.</p>

<p>In a 10-year study, we assessed the influence of five carbon (C) treatments on the labile C and nitrogen (N) pools of historically N enriched plots on the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research site located in northeastern Colorado. For eight years, we applied sawdust, sugar, industrial lignin, sawdust + sugar, and lignin + sugar to plots that had received N and water additions in the early 1970s. Previous work showed that past water and N additions altered plant species composition and enhanced rates of nutrient cycling; these effects were still apparent 25 years later. We hypothesized that labile C amendments would stimulate microbial activity and suppress rates of N mineralization, whereas complex forms of carbon (sawdust and lignin) could enhance humification and lead to longer-term reductions in N availability. Results indicated that of the five carbon treatments, sugar, sawdust, and sawdust + sugar suppressed N availability, with sawdust + sugar being the most effective treatment to reduce N availability. The year after treatments stopped, N availability remained less in the sawdust + sugar treatment plots than in the high-N control plots. Three years after treatments ended, reductions in N availability were smaller (40-60%). Our results suggest that highly labile forms of carbon generate strong short- term N sinks, but these effects dissipate within one year of application, and that more recalcitrant forms reduce N longer. Sawdust + sugar was the most effective treatment to decrease exotic species canopy cover and increase native species density over the long term. Labile carbon had neither short- nor long-term effects on exotic species. Even though the organic amendments did not contribute to recovery of the dominant native species Bouteloua gracilis, they were effective in increasing another native species, Carex eleocharis. These results indicate that organic amendments may be a useful tool for restoring some native species in the shortgrass steppe.</p>

<p>Body size is a fundamental biological measurement that is known to be related to an organism's physiology, life-history and ecology. Estimates of body size are also widely used in comparative evolutionary and ecological studies, including food web and diet studies that require estimates of biomass. Beginning in 1994, small mammals are live-trapped twice each year on the three grassland and three shrubland trapping webs. Individuals are weighed (to nearest 0.5 g using a Pesola spring scale) when first captured during a given trapping session but not upon recapture during the same session. Weights are calculated by subtracting the weight of an empty capture (ziploc) bag from the weight of animal in the bag. Individuals are classified into age classes (adult, subadult, juvenile) in the field based on a combination of size and pelage characteristics. This dataset gives means, standard deviations, minimum and maximum values for body weight, in grams, of small mammals captured between September 1994 and September 2008. All sites and sampling periods were combined. Most individuals (~93%) were classified as new captures, although a few individuals that were captured multiple times across different trapping sessions may appear in the dataset more than once. Values may differ from estimates calculated using the entire capture dataset because age and weight data were screened more closely to omit obvious errors and outliers.</p>

<p>Small mammals (rabbits, rodents) are integral components of semiarid ecosystems because of their roles as consumers of plants, seeds and arthropods, as soil disturbance agents, and as food for raptors, snakes and mammalian carnivores. Because of their vagility and intermediate trophic position, populations of small mammals may track changes in vegetation and the abiotic environment that may result from shifts in land-use and other anthropogenic disturbances. However, these populations are variable over space and time, and their response to environmental changes may not be immediately apparent given their behavioral flexibility and relatively long life-spans and generation times. Patterns in the distribution and abundance of small mammals thus may simultaneously reflect and affect the stability of the shortgrass-steppe ecosystem. Long-term studies of population and community dynamics therefore are needed to fully understand the role of small mammals in grassland ecosystems. In 1994, we implemented a sampling scheme to monitor long-term changes in relative abundance of small mammals in representative habitats of shortgrass steppe. We live-trapped nocturnal rodents twice each year (spring, late summer) on trapping webs in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Three 3.14-ha webs were established in each habitat. Each web had 124 Sherman traps, which were spaced 10-m apart on 12 100-m spokes, with 30 degrees between spokes. Four traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive nights in each trapping session. Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats, set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex, age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study, individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals, providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags, although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals, we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old, O), versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd, 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session. The location of one trapping web was changed from 13NE (1994-1997) to 13SW (1998- present) because of concerns about intensive cattle use in the pasture, as well as activity of CPER Site Manager’s cats.</p>

Patterns in the distribution and abundance of small mammals thus may simultaneously reflect and affect the stability of the shortgrass-steppe ecosystem. Long-term studies of population and community dynamics therefore are needed to fully understand the role of small mammals in grassland ecosystems. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, SPTR) are the most widely distributed rodent species in shortgrass steppe and the most important in terms of abundance and biomass. Like most rodents in shortgrass steppe, they are omnivorous; unlike other species, however, they are diurnal and active aboveground only 5-6 months each year, and therefore required a separate sampling scheme from other rodents. In 1999, we initiated studies to track long-term changes in relative abundance of ground squirrels in representative habitats of shortgrass steppe. We live-trapped squirrels twice each year, which corresponded to periods of high aboveground activity of adults (early June, SPR) and the emergence of juveniles (mid-July, SUM). Three 3.14-ha webs were established in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Each web had 62 Sherman traps, which were spaced 20-m apart on 12 100-m spokes, with 30 degrees between spokes. Two traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive mornings in each trapping session. Traps were baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats, set at dawn and closed 4-6 hours later. Traps were shaded with pieces of PVC pipe to reduce heat mortality in traps. We recorded sex, age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. Because the ears of squirrels are too small to consistently hold ear tags, all individuals were batch-marked with a colored Sharpie felt marker to distinguish recaptures ® from new (N) individuals, providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. NOTE: In this dataset, ages and weights may not correspond well. Weight, combined with sampling date, can be used to better determine age class; contact Paul Stapp for more information.</p>

<p>The abundance and diversity of small mammals in shortgrass steppe is strongly influenced by the structure and composition of vegetation. Vegetation structure provides cover from predators and harsh abiotic conditions. Plant species composition affects the types of seeds and herbaceous material available to granivores and herbivores, and influences arthropod populations, which are important prey for the omnivorous species that dominate in shortgrass steppe. Both vegetation structure and plant community composition are sensitive to the availability of precipitation as well as the activity of large mammalian herbivores. In 1999, we began measuring vegetation structure and plant community composition on the three grassland and three shrubland trapping webs where we live-trap small mammals. Vegetation measurements are made once each year, usually in mid-July. Percent canopy cover of each plant species was estimated visually in 30 0.10-m2 Daubenmire quadrats on each web. To estimate habitat structure, we measured the height of grass, forb and shrub plants adjacent to each quadrat, the density of half-shrubs, small mammal mounds and burrows, harvester ant mounds and the dimensions of large shrubs and animal mounds.</p>

<p>With the exception of heteromyids, eg kangaroo rats and pocket mice, most small rodents in shortgrass steppe are omnivorous. Depending on season, arthropods (insects and arachnids) make up 40-85% of the diet of grasshopper mice and thirteen-lined ground squirrels, the most widespread rodents in northern shortgrass steppe. Small mammals are among the most important predators of ground-dwelling macroarthropods and herbivorous insects provide a direct resource link between weather and plant production. Understanding temporal variability in the abundance of arthropods is central to determining the mechanisms that drive small rodent populations. At present, there are no long-term studies of arthropods in shortgrass steppe, despite the important role that these taxa play in grassland food webs. Beginning in 1998, we implemented field protocols to track changes in relative abundance of terrestrial macroarthropods in grassland and shrub-dominated habitats of shortgrass steppe. Sampling was conducted on the six trapping webs (three upland prairie, three lowland saltbush) where we studied rodent populations, and was conducted approximately monthly from May-September (4-5 sessions/year). Ground-dwelling macroarthropods were sampled on each web using pitfall traps, set in one four-by-five grid, with 10 m between traps. Traps consisted of plastic cups (90-mm diameter, 120 mm deep), including a plastic funnel (90-mm diameter), buried flush with the ground surface. Traps were shaded with wooden covers held in place with nails; traps could be closed when not operational by nailing the cover flush to the ground. Traps were usually open for 4 consecutive days (ie 80 trap-days) during a trapping session. On the 4th day, captured arthropods were removed from the traps, identified and released. All arthropods were identified to the ordinal level; beetles (Coleoptera), crickets (Orthoptera), true bugs (Hemiptera) and spiders were identified to the familial level; and a few taxa, eg tenebrionid beetles, were identified to species. We also recorded any reptiles and amphibians captured. The number of individuals of each taxa captured per 100 trap-days was used as an index of relative abundance, with adjustments made for traps that were flooded or disturbed by cattle or for changes to the number of days that traps were open (range 4-7 days). We sampled grasshoppers by counting the numbers flushed from 0.78-m2 circular plots (hoops) placed on each web. Hoops were set out on the day that pitfall traps were opened and were surveyed on the day that traps were closed. A technician used a wooden lath to flush and count all grasshoppers from each hoop. Grasshoppers were not identified to species. Surveys were conducted in 1998, then were discontinued until 2002. In 1998 and from 2002-2005, nine hoops were sampled on each web. Beginning in 2006, we sampled a total of 20 hoops on each web.</p>

<p>Carnivores are among the most conspicuous, charismatic and economically important mammals in shortgrass steppe, yet relatively is little is known about their populations or of the ecological factors that determine their distribution and abundance, in part because densities tend to be low. Mammalian carnivores represent the top predators in grassland food webs, consuming rodents, rabbits, young ungulates and other small vertebrates. In addition, shortgrass steppe is the primary habitat of the swift fox (Vulpes velox), a species of special conservation concern throughout most of its range. Fox populations are thought to be limited by predation from coyotes (Canis latrans), the most common carnivore in these grasslands and a species of interest, both for its ecological roles and well as a target species for human exploitation, ie hunting and predator control. In 1994, we implemented a low-intensity sampling scheme to monitor long-term changes in relative abundance of mammalian carnivores and help us examine interactions between these predators and their small mammal prey, including rodents and rabbits. We estimated relative abundance of carnivores using scat surveys along a fixed route. Four times each year (January, April, July, October), we drove a 32-km route consisting of pasture two-track and gravel roads on the CPER. We first drove the route to remove all scats (‘PRE-census’); we then returned ~14 d later and counted the number of scats deposited on the route (‘CENSUS’). We recorded the species that deposited the scat and estimated the scat age based on external appearance (4 categories). Beginning in 1997, we recorded the vegetation (habitat) type and topographic position of all scat locations to describe habitat use. Latrines are indicated by locations containing multiple scats. We used the ‘CENSUS’ data to calculate a scat index, defined as the number of scats deposited per km of road per night. The scat index can be used to estimate population density using equations for coyotes (Knowlton 1982) and swift foxes (Schauster et al. 2002) that described the rate of scat deposition from surveys where density was known. To estimate density and compare trends among seasons and years, we omitted scats collected along the 8.3 km of the route that occurred on gravel county roads. These roads are graded sporadically, sometimes between pre-census and census surveys, which tended to remove scats. (NOTE: these observations are NOT omitted in the dataset).</p>

<p>Rabbits are the most important small-mammal herbivores in shortgrass steppe, and may significant influence the physiognomy and population dynamics of herbaceous plants and woody shrubs. Rabbits also are the most important prey of mammalian carnivores such as coyotes and large raptors such as golden eagles and great horned owls. Two hares (Lepus californicus, L. townsendii) and one cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus audubonii) occur in shortgrass steppe. In 1994, we initiated long-term studies to track changes in relative abundance of rabbits on the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER). On four nights each year (one night each season, usually on new moon nights in January, April, July, October), we drove a 32-km route consisting of pasture two-track and gravel roads on the CPER. This was the same route as that driven for carnivore scat counts. Surveys began at twilight. Observers with two spotlights sat in the back of a 4WD pick-up driven at &lt;15 mph. We recorded the perpendicular distance (in m) to each rabbit using a meter tape or range finder; the direction of the rabbit relative to the road; and noted if individuals were solitary or in clusters. We also recorded any carnivores or other animals seen during spotlight surveys. Beginning in Spring 1998, we recorded the vegetation type (habitat) and topographic position of each rabbit seen, as well as position relative to human features, eg windmills, cattle guards, on the landscape. We used the number of rabbits of each species spotted per km of route as an index of relative abundance. We used line-transect approaches in DISTANCE to estimate population densities from perpendicular distance data.</p>

<p>The belowground system in arid and semiarid regions can be of relatively greater importance than in more mesic systems because plant competition is most often for soil water rather than for light in aboveground canopies. Belowground plant biomass in the shortgrass steppe represents approximately 80% of the total. These data, entitled Long-Term Seasonal Root Biomass, were obtained in section 21 of the Central Plains Experimental Range from 1985-2008 in conjunction with a 14C labeling experiment designed to test isotope methods of estimating root production. Paired plots for each of eight replicate 14C labeled plots were established and cored on average six times per year over 13 years (five cores each plot each date as above). There were two primary objectives for collecting these data, 1) to compare estimates of root production (or belowground net primary production - BNPP) obtained using the sequential coring of biomass methods with various isotope, minirhizotron, ingrowth, and other methods, and 2) to examine long-term controls on the temporal dynamics of root biomass. This shortgrass steppe LTER site is the only place we are aware of that has compared most methods of estimating BNPP, including sequential coring, ingrowth cores, and ingrowth donuts, 14C pulse-isotope dilution, 14C pulse-isotope turnover, rhizotron windows, and minirhizotron, and indirect methods including nitrogen budget, carbon flux, simulation carbon flow model, and regression model. All production methods are compared in Milchunas (2009), and more detailed comparisons among particular methods can be found in Milchunas and Lauenroth (1992, 2001), and Milchunas et al. (2005a, and 2005b). Results and conclusions concerning root biomass dynamics and relationships with precipitation, season, and aboveground biomass are reported primarily in Milchunas and Lauenroth (2001).

These pedons are located on the major physiographic units at the CPER, and contain deposits of suspected fluvial and eolian origin. To examine spatial variability, the pedons were typically sampled along transects spaced at 30m intervals. Samples were taken with a hydraulic soil probe to the depth of probe refusal and from suitable stream and road cuts. All soils were described and sampled by genetic horizon (Soil Survey Staff, 1992), and analyzed at Colorado State University. Analyses included particle size and organic C. Nineteen of the 41 pedons were subjected to stable isotopic analysis of organic C and carbonate.

<p>CPER Paleopedology Study – Particle and Grain Size - Grain size data from 39 pedons were compared with modal fluvial (7) and eolian (3) samples in order to characterize the origin of CPER parent materials and distinguish the origin of CPER geomorphic features. The seven fluvial sites were located along Owl and Eastman Creeks. The three eolian sites were located on the nearest undisputed dune fields located approximately 5 km north of Roggen, CO (Muhs, 1985). For statistical analysis, the sand and coarse silt fractions were shaken in a nest of half phi(0) interval sieves ranging from -1.0 0 (10 mesh) to 4.5 0 (325 mesh) for 3 minutes. Phi intervals (-log2) were utilized to normalize the particle size data for use in conventional statistics (Krumbein, 1934). The silt and clay fractions were separated by sedimentation using the pipette method. Statistical methods adopted from Folk and Ward (1957) were applied to the -1.0 0 to 7.0 0 fractions using the Sedimentary Petrology Computer Program SEDPET (Warner, 1970) to determine mean grain size (Mz), sorting (Iz), skewness (Skz), and kurtosis (Kz). These parameters were then subjected to univariate and bivariate analysis. The clay fraction was not included in the statistical computations to avoid excessively fine skewing the sample.

<p>The Breeding Bird Survey is a large-scale survey of North American birds. It is a roadside survey, primarily covering the continental United States and southern Canada, although survey routes have recently been initiated in Alaska and northern Mexico. The BBS was started in 1966, and the over 3,500 routes are surveyed in June by experienced birders. Routes 305, Nunn and 901, Rockport are located in the area of the SGS research site. The primary objective of the BBS has been the estimation of population change for songbirds. However, the data have many potential uses, and investigators have used the data to address a variety of research and management objectives. In the USGS-BBS Home Page, results from the BBS are summarized and pictures of birds and other species are information. Data from 1966 - 2002 were managed by the SGS-LTER project.

<p>Production of seeds of Bouteloua gracilis was evaluated for a semiarid grassland in northeastern Colorado. Ten locations were chosed to represent the range in soil textures and grazing intensities found at the Central Plains Experiemental Range research site. Number of flowering culms, inforescences and seeds, length of each flowering clum, total biomass or reproductive structures (culms, inforescences and seeds), and basal areas were assessed for each plant sampled. Community-level estimates of density of flowering culms and density of viable seeds are made for each location. Both soil texture and grazing intensity by cattle are important to spatial variability in seed production and other indicators of reproductive effort by B. gracilis.

<p> The objective of the long-term ANPP study is to monitor long-term net above ground primary production of the shortgrass steppe community by species.

<p>CPER SOC across Toposequences - Pedons and their corresponding topography were described along an 8 km transect oriented normal to the major drainages of the CPER. A total of 140 pedons representing 23 toposequences and 7 plains segments were characterized. Sampling sites were selected within toposequences according to slope position (summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope, toeslope) and within plains segments at approximate 100 m intervals. Pedons were described and sampled by genetic horizon according to the standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Analyses, conducted at Colorado State University, included particle size and organic C. Bulk density was estimated empirically according to: Rawls, W.J. 1983. Estimating soil bulk density form particle size analysis and organic matter content. Soil Sci 135: 123-125. Organic C accumulation was measured along an 8 km transect at a site in the semiarid shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Specific objectives of the study were to (I) measure the quantity and distribution of organic C across toposequences, (ii) test the hypothesis that a disproportionate amount of soil organic C resides in the lowlands (as defined herein), and (iii) assess the role of geomorphic history as a determinant of contemporary rates of biogeochemical organic C transformations. Results of the study showed the surface (A) horizon organic C concentration did not vary systematically among slope positions of a given toposequence. Similarly, the mass of organic C within the surface meter of soil often did not increase with decreasing elevation across a toposequence. Mass of organic C was found to range from 2.5 kg m^-3 on terrace escarpments to 10.7 kg m^-3 on sandy uplands. The mass of organic C, as calculated to the BCk horizon, was highest in the lowlands. The mass of buried organic C, as calculated uniformly for a 50 cm thickness of material, represents 17% of the total organic C estimate for the site. In spite of buried soils, lowlands did not contain a disproportionate amount of total landscape organic C.

Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986). Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson & Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown & Heske 1990, Brown & Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson & Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger & Brown 1981, Brown & Zeng 1989, Brown & Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown & Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer & Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers.</p>

Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson & Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown & Heske 1990, Brown & Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson & Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger & Brown 1981, Brown & Zeng 1989, Brown & Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown & Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer & Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers.</p>

Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986).

Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986). Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson & Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown & Heske 1990, Brown & Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson & Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger & Brown 1981, Brown & Zeng 1989, Brown & Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown & Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer & Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers.</p>

<p>Soil test fertilizer recommendations have long been predicated upon response curves generated from fertility trials across the country. These response curves have been compared to relative yield which provide probability ranges for a response to varying fertilizer inputs. Category responses include very low, low, adequate, high or very high inversely related to probability of a response to various inputs of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium (N, P, and K).</p>
<p>New soil test methods, increases in computing power and access to the internet have enabled development of an interactive tool that is based on plant available NPK from both the inorganic fraction and organic pool of the soil. The new methods provide an estimate of plant available nutrients that the soil naturally provides, which has largely been ignored for decades.</p>
<p>Since we have access to large datasets we can calculate the amounts of NPK required growing crops in lbs NPK per bu of the desired crop. For example, it requires 100 lbs of N, 50 lbs P2O5, 50 lbs K2O to grow 100 bu corn. These are the base numbers from which we subtract the soil test data after converting from the analytical ppm to Lbs P2O5 or lbs K2O. This is a straight subtraction. It also eliminates the need for ""calibration data"" since the soil tests reflect the soils inherent fertility. Using the example above, of 100, 50, 50 of N, P, and K required and soil test results of 25, 35, 45 then the fertilizer needed would be 75 N, 15 P2O5 and 5 K2O. This is a simple approach that doesn't get lost in relative yield-crop response curves that have been used for decades from differing geographical areas.</p>
<p>This tool will include current fertilizer prices, soil test inputs, and crop based county averages for the last 15 years that will predict the chances of making the yield goal the user inputs compared to historical yield data for their county and calculate the fertilizer cost with and without soil testing compared to user input yield goal and county average. This tool will allow the user via the internet to produce a more straightforward approach to realistically planning next year's fertilizer inputs and associated cost. It will also show the benefits of soil testing for increased fertilizer efficiency and reduced environmental impact.</p>

<p>The diversity of geo-climatic land bases and potential feedstocks within the United States Central Great Plains (CGP) requires sustainable production that provides optimal resource utilization while maintaining or enhancing localized soil and environmental quality as much as possible. This study examined average annual changes in soil erosion from rainfall and wind forces and trends in soil organic carbon (SOC) as a function of commodity and/or bioenergy-based crop rotations, yield variations, and different field management practices, including residue removal across all land capability class (LCC) I-VIII soils in select areas of the CGP. Soil erosion and SOC (proxied by a soil conditioning index, or SCI) were analyzed on individual soil map unit components using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, Version 2 (RUSLE2) and Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) models.</p>

This dataset contains reservoir data from stations in SGP97 domain. The data collected at USGS gaging stations consist of records of stage and measurements of discharge of streams or canals, and stage, surface area, and contents of lakes or reservoirs. This dataset contains only the USGS reservoir data. For a lake or reservoir, capacity tables giving the contents for any stage are prepared from stage-area relation curves defined by surveys. The application of the stage to the capacity table gives the contents, from which the daily, monthly, or yearly change in contents is computed. If the stage-capacity curve is subject to changes because of deposition of sediment in the reservoir, periodic resurveys of the reservoir are necessary to define new stage-capacity curves.  During the period between reservoir surveys, the computed contents may be increasingly in error due to the gradual accumulation of sediments. For some gaging stations there are periods when no gage-height record is obtained or the recorded gage height is so faulty that it cannot be used to compute daily discharge or contents. This happens when the recorder stops or otherwise fails to operate properly, intakes are plugged, the float is frozen in the well, or for various other reasons. For such periods, the daily contents may be estimated on the basis of operator's log, prior and subsequent records, inflow-outflow studies, and other information. The USGS reservoir data are provided in a single file and are provided ""as is"" in their original card image format.

This dataset contains stream flow data from 997 USGS stations in the SGP97 domain. The data collected at USGS gaging stations consist of records of stage and measurements of discharge of streams or canals, and stage, surface area, and contents of lakes or reservoirs. This dataset contains only the USGS stream flow data. For USGS stream-gaging stations, the daily mean discharge is computed from gage heights and rating tables. These rating tables are prepared from stage-discharge-relation curves and give the discharge for any stage. If the stage-discharge relation for a station is temporarily changed by the presence of aquatic growth or debris on the control, the daily mean discharge is computed by what is basically the shifting-control method. At some USGS gaging stations, acoustic velocity meter (AVM) systems are used to compute discharge. The AVM system measures the stream's velocity at one or more paths in the cross section. Coefficients are developed to relate this path velocity to the mean velocity in the cross section. Cross-sectional area curves are developed to relate stage to cross section area. Discharge is computed by multiplying path velocity by the appropriate stage related coefficient and area. Changing stage, backwater from reservoirs, tributary streams, or other sources, and ice in the winter affect the stage-discharge relation. Special methods, such as using comparable records of discharge for other stations, are then used to compute discharge. If no gage-height record can be obtained from a gaging station due to failed equipment, etc., daily discharge values are estimated using various means. The USGS stream flow dataset contains three metadata parameters and three data parameters. The metadata parameters identify the network, station, and time at which the data was collected. Each record contains one month's data. The three data parameters (stream flow, stage, and hour of observation) are repeated once for each UTC day (0000 to 2300). All records contain data for 31 days regardless of the actual number of days in a month. Months with less than 31 days are padded with missing values (e.g., -999.99). The stream flow values are reported in cubic meters per second and are 24 hour averages. There are no stage values in this dataset, so the stage values are shown as missing. The hour of observation is the beginning UTC hour for the 24 hour period for which the stream flow value is valid. No additional quality control was performed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS).</p>

The full Eta MOLTS dataset covers most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains (up to 574 locations). MOLTS are hourly time series output at selected locations that contain values for various surface parameters and ‘sounding’ profiles at Eta model levels, and are derived from the Eta model output. The MOLTS output files were converted into Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) Quality Control Format (QCF), the same format used for atmospheric rawinsonde soundings processed by JOSS. The MOLTS output provided by JOSS on-line includes only the initial analysis output (i.e. no forecast MOLTS) and only state parameters (pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind). The full output, including the forecast MOLTS and all output parameters, in its original format (Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data, or BUFR) is available from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)/Scientific Computing Division. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) began operations for the Eta model in June 1993 with a resolution of 80 km and 38 levels; the top level was 50 mb. In late 1994, the domain of the Eta model was increased and the resolution became 48 km with 38 levels. The Eta analysis and forecast fields are generated every 12 hours at 0000 and 1200 UTC daily. MOLTS are hourly vertical profile and surface time series derived from the Eta model output. The complete MOLTS output includes a changable number of informational items, parameters for each level, and parameters at the surface.

The herbicide data collected in GCEW are documented at plot, field, and watershed scales. This 20-yr-long (1991-2010) effort was augmented with a spatially broad effort within the Central Mississippi River Basin encompassing 12 related claypan watersheds in the Salt River Basin, two cave streams on the fringe of the Central Claypan Areas in the Bonne Femme watershed, and 95 streams in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The research effort on herbicide transport has highlighted the importance of restrictive soil layers with smectitic mineralogy to the risk of transport vulnerability. Near-surface soil features, such as claypans and argillic horizons, result in greater herbicide transport than soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivities and low smectitic clay content.</p>

The parents of the linkage populations are upland tetraploids.  The association populations are primarily of the upland ecotype, both tetraploid and octoploid, with a few lowland tetraploids as well. A total of 350 GB of sequence was generated from 840 individuals using GBS. Over 1.2 million putative SNPs were discovered with the UNEAK pipeline.  In addition, ultra-high density paternal and maternal linkage maps, of 41K and 46K SNPs, respectively, were also constructed based on the conserved synteny between switchgrass and foxtail millet.</p>

In semi- desert grasslands, for example, Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggested that overgrazing can result in desertification through a shift from primarily grasses to desert shrubs. Changes in plant communities can also occur as a result of introduced species, artificial watering, plant removal for human use, disease, competition, and prolonged drought. In the future, global problems, such as the greenhouse effect, could possibly lead to climate changes (and therefore changes in vegetation) that we can only attempt to predict. Changes in plant composition have the potential to cause disturbances in both structure and function throughout the ecosystem. One element of the ecosystem that could possibly be affected is bird diversity and behavior. Several studies such as Dixon (1959), Raitt and Pimm (1976), Naranjo and Raitt (1993), MacAurthur et al. (1962), Vander Wall and MacMahon (1984) and Raitt and Maze (1968), all suggest that certain species of birds depend more, or entirely, on habitats containing specific functional groups or species of vegetation. According to Naranjo and Raitt (1993), habitat preferences in birds develop because of factors such as availability of food, nesting and perching locations, and cover. Birds may utilize some plant species more than other plant species. Vander Wall and MacMahon (1984) suggest that some particular plant species are ideally suited to particular bird species. For example, the northern mockingbird relies on tall plants for perching and singing sites. Other plant species provide cover for birds like the Gambel's Quail. Certain species of birds may also use a wider variety of different plants because of broad habitat requirements. In this study we examine how different types of plant types and growth affect bird abundance, bird species diversity, and bird activity in the Chihuahuan desert.</p>

<p>Since its establishment in 1953, the SWRC in Tucson, Arizona, has collected, processed, managed, and disseminated high-resolution, spatially distributed hydrologic data in support of the center's mission. Data management at the SWRC has evolved through time in response to new computing, storage, and data access technologies. In 1996, the SWRC initiated a multiyear project to upgrade rainfall and runoff sensors and convert analog systems to digital electronic systems supported by data loggers. This conversion was coupled with radio telemetry to remotely transmit recorded data to a central computer, thus greatly reducing operational overhead by reducing labor, maintenance, and data processing time. A concurrent effort was initiated to improve access to SWRC data by creating a system based on a relational database supporting access to the data via the Internet. An SWRC team made up of scientists, IT specialists, programmers, hydrologic technicians, and instrumentation specialists was formed. This effort is termed the Southwest Watershed Research Center Data Access Project (DAP).</p>
<p>The goal of the SWRC DAP is to efficiently disseminate data to researchers; land owners, users, and managers; and to the public. Primary access to the data is provided through a Web-based user interface. In addition, data can be accessed directly from within the SWRC network. The first priority for the DAP was to assimilate and make available rainfall and runoff data collected from two instrumented field sites, the WGEW near Tombstone, Arizona, and the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) south of Tucson, Arizona.</p>

Following January 1, 1987, spring line- intercepts will only record cover of annual species. All perennial cover data will be limited to fall samples. Both annuals and perennials are measured during the fall. Measurements were made biannually from 1982 - 1988. After this they are measured every 5 years. Annuals are measured through 1998; however, after this only perennials are measured and only in the fall. Each plant line transect is divided into 6 5-meter segments. Annuals are measured only in the first meter of segments 1, 2, and 3 and in the last meter of segments 4, 5, and 6. Perennials are measured for the full length of all segments. BACKGROUND. In the spring of 1982, as part of the establishment of the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in southern New Mexico, a 135 ha portion of a 1500 ha, internally drained, watershed was exclosed from grazing by domestic livestock. Prior to exclosure the watershed, as well as the rest of the Jornada basin, had been moderately to heavily grazed for the past 100 years. Concurrent with grazing, the vegetation had undergone a dramatic change from desert grassland, with an almost continuous cover of C4 perennial grasses, to isolated patches of the original grassland in a mosaic with desert shrub dominated plant communities (Buffington and Herbel, 1965). The exclosure lies along a northeast facing piedmont slope at the base of a steep isolated mountain peak, and covers a variety of component landforms from the foot of the mountain to the basin floor. This provided the opportunity to investigate the response of vegetation with respect to landscape characteristics as well as release from grazing.</p>

<p>Quantifying water flow and chemical transport in the vadose zone typically requires knowledge of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties. The UNsaturated SOil hydraulic DAtabase (UNSODA) was developed to provide a source of unsaturated hydraulic data and some other soil properties for practitioners and researchers. A first MS-DOS version of the database was released in 1996. It has been applied in numerous studies. In this paper, we describe the second version (UNSODA V2.0) for use with Microsoft Access-97®1. The format and structure of the new database have been modified to provide additional and more convenient options for data searches, to provide compatibility with other programs for easy loading and downloading of data, and to allow users to customise the contents and look of graphical output. This paper reviews the structure and contents of the database as well as the operations that can be performed on the different data types in UNSODA V2.0. The use and application of the new database are illustrated with two examples. The retrieval of data is briefly illustrated, followed by a more detailed example regarding the interpolation of soil particle-size distribution data obtained according to different national definitions of particle-size classes. The interpolation procedure, which is based on finding similar particle-size distribution curves from a large European data set, also performed well for soils that originate from other geographical areas.</p>

Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the ""Primary Data Set"" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR. <br />
 <br />
The current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014, is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014. Nutrient profiles were added for 265 new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).  New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods such as several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample.</p>

These studies have provided current and accurate estimates of data to update SR, and the study results have been incorporated into data sets that can be used for nutrient labeling. NDL has developed these data sets, presented in an easy-to-use table format.  </p>
<p>Each data set provides retailers with easier access to the most accurate nutrient data for the purpose of on-pack nutrition labeling and for nutrition claims. These data sets focus on the cuts identified by USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) proposed labeling regulations for fresh, single-ingredient meats. The FSIS, an agency of the USDA, is the public health agency responsible for ensuring that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.</p>

Twelve treatments involved different water availability targeted at specific growth-stages. This dataset includes data from the first two years, which were complete years with intact treatments.  Data includes canopy growth and development (canopy height, canopy cover and LAI), irrigation, precipitation, and soil water storage measured periodically through the season; daily estimates of crop evapotranspiration; and seasonal measurement of crop water use, harvest index and crop yield. Hourly and daily weather data are also provided from the CoAgMET, Colorado’s network of meteorological information (<a href=""https://coagmet.colostate.edu/"">https://coagmet.colostate.edu/</a> ; GLY04 station). Additional soil data can be found in a previous dataset (USDA-ARS Colorado Maize Water Productivity Dataset 2008-2011) also available from the Ag Data Commons.

Two sheets (one sheet for each of the two years) provide the hourly weather data, with the exception of the precipitation data, which is included in the sheet with daily data per treatment. The weather data is from a weather station on site. Another sheet provides plot level data (harvest index, yield, annual ET, maximum LAI, stand density, total aboveground biomass) taken annually by plot (four plots per treatment). Another sheet provides LAI measured four times over each season per plot. The final sheet provides daily data per treatment over each season, including data needed to compute daily water balance. This sheet has LAI, crop growth stage, plant height, estimated root depth, interpolated canopy cover, ET coefficients, precipitation, and estimated deep percolation, evaporation, and soil water deficit at four soil depths.</p>

For each monitored furrow, irrigation inflow rates, outflow rates, and sediment concentrations were recorded periodically during the irrigation.  A gated pipe conveyed irrigation water across the plots at the head, or inflow-end, of the furrows and adjustable spigots supplied water to each irrigated furrow.  The methodology used to obtain the field data is described by Lentz and Sojka (2009).  Inflows were measured by timing the filling rate of a known volume, and runoff were measured with long-throated, v-notch flumes. Outflows were measured and runoff samples collected at 30 min intervals during the first 1-3 hr of an irrigation, and every hour or two for the next 3 to 5 hr.  If the set was continued for an additional 12 hr, two to four additional measurements were made.  Immediately after each flume reading, sediment concentration in furrow streams were measured by collecting one-liter runoff samples from free-flowing flume discharge.  The weight of sediment per liter of runoff was determined from the settled volume of sediment using the Imhoff-cone technique.  Three Imhoff-cone sediment samples were collected from each treatment in each irrigation.  These were filtered, and the papers dried and weighed.  A calibration function relating the 30-min, settled-sediment volume to sediment mass-per-unit-volume of runoff was then calculated and used to convert settled sediment volume in cones to sediment mass.</p>
<p>The field data for each study or year were analyzed using the WASHOUT program (Lentz and Sojka, 1995).  The WASHOUT program produces an output file (filename.out), which become components of this Ag Data Commons data set.</p>
<p>For many years and irrigations, furrows were monitored at one or more locations along the furrow, as well as at the end (bottom) of the furrow.  In these cases, data for each position within the furrow are listed in the data set, labelled for example as 'Top', 'Middle', and 'Bottom' (See Data Dictionary tab).  For each furrow position the data represent the flow, infiltration, and runoff information for the length of furrow, which begins at its inflow end (top of the field) and ends at the defined furrow position.  This distance is listed in the field data file for each furrow and irrigation.</p>
<p>An Irrigation Data Summary is included as a tab in the data set spreadsheet.  This is a summary list of the studies and irrigations that are included in the data set.  Also included is a PAM-Application-Codes tab that lists description of the polyacrylamide (PAM) treatments that were employed in some of the included studies.</p>

The WGEW is a tributary of the San Pedro River, surrounds the town of Tombstone in southeastern Arizona, and has a drainage area of approximately 149 km2. Elevation of the watershed ranges from 1220 m to 1950 m above mean sea level (MSL). Average annual precipitation for the period of 1956-2005, as measured with six gauges, is roughly 312 mm, with approximately 60% falling during the summer monsoon. Precipitation consists almost solely of rainfall with relatively rare instances of hail and snowfall. From a historical high of 95 rain gauges, a current network of 88 gauges is operational. This constitutes one of the densest rain gauge networks in the world (0.6 gauges/km2) for watersheds greater than 10 km2. Through 1999, the network consisted of analog recording weighing rain gauges. In 2000, a newly designed digital gauge with telemetry was placed adjacent (1 m) to the analog gauges.

Runoff occurs at Walnut Gulch primarily as a result of convective thunderstorms during the months of July through September. Runoff volume and flow duration are correlated with drainage area as a result of the limited areal extent of runoff producing rainfall and transmission losses or infiltration of the flood wave into the channel alluvium. Runoff is measured at three ranges of watershed size: small, 0.0018-0.059 km2; medium, 0.35-1.60 km2; and large, 2.27-149 km2. The small watersheds are termed ‘‘unit source area watersheds'' and were established to quantify the interaction of rainfall intensity patterns, soils, vegetation, and management on the rates and amounts runoff and sediment production. The medium watersheds were established at preexisting small earthen dams or stock tanks to obtain inexpensive measurements of storm runoff volume and annual sediment yield. The large watersheds were established to quantify the effects of the spatial and temporal variability of thunderstorm rainfall and channel characteristics on water yield, peak discharge, and sediment yield. Runoff was originally measured using a stilling well, float, and analog stage recorders (Stevens A-35, Friez FD-4, Friez FW-1) with mechanical clocks to record the timing of the event. In 1999, digital recorders consisting of potentiometers attached to the stilling well gear mechanism and a Campbell Scientific CR-10 data logger were added to all of the runoff measurement stations. At present, both the analog and digital data are being collected and are archived.</p>

Sediment loads carried through the channel network on the WGEW are high, but are typical of semiarid rangelands, and are influenced by soils, geologic parent material, and geomorphology. Typical monsoon thunderstorm generated flows in dryland regions are characterized by high velocities, short durations, and heavy and coarse sediment loads. Sediment is measured in conjunction with discharge measurements [Stone et al., 2008] that are integral to converting sample values to runoff event-based values. Sampling initiated in the 1960s was done with point intake pump samplers. The single point sampler intake tubes were later replaced with tubes that rise in response to flow and are perforated to collect depth integrated samples. Sampling with each of these systems is limited to suspended sediment smaller than the 0.635 cm diameter of the intake slots. Pump samplers are in use at the outlet of small watersheds where overland flow is the dominant hydrologic driver of sediment transport, and particles are small. As watershed size increases on the WGEW, in general, the channel network can dominate sediment delivery processes as it evolves to carry an increasingly coarse, and vertically sorted, sediment load. A traversing slot sediment sampler was designed in response to limitations of alternative sampling methods such as the pump sampler. The data collection network was expanded in 2002 and pit traps were added below the overfall at flumes 63.103 and 63.104. Analysis of these data, and efforts to process and make available the historic data, are ongoing.</p>

<p>The objective of the Water Erosion Prediction Project is to develop new generation prediction technology for use by the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA-Forest Service, USDI-Bureau of Land Management, and others involved in soil and water conservation and environmental planning and assessment. This improved erosion prediction technology is based on modern hydrologic and erosion science, is process-oriented, and is computer-implemented. This document is a detailed description of the WEPP erosion model as developed for application to small watersheds and hillslope profiles within those watersheds. The WEPP erosion model is a continuous simulation computer program which predicts soil loss and sediment deposition from overland flow on hillslopes, soil loss and sediment deposition from concentrated flow in small channels, and sediment deposition in impoundments. In addition to the erosion components, it also includes a climate component which uses a stochastic generator to provide daily weather information, a hydrology component which is based on a modified Green-Ampt infiltration equation and solutions of the kinematic wave equations, a daily water balance component, a plant growth and residue decomposition component, and an irrigation component. The WEPP model computes spatial and temporal distributions of soil loss and deposition, and provides explicit estimates of when and where in a watershed or on a hillslope that erosion is occurring so that conservation measures can be selected to most effectively control soil loss and sediment yield.</p>

The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover.

These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.

After the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.

The Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report.

Land resource categories historically used at State and national levels are land resource units, land resource areas, and land resource regions. Land resource units (LRUs) are the basic units from which major land resource areas (MLRAs) are determined.  They are also the basic units for State land resource maps.  LRUs are typically coextensive with State general soil map units, but some general soil map units are subdivided into LRUs because of significant geographic differences in soils, climate, water resources, or land use.  LRUs generally are several thousand acres in size.  A unit can be one continuous area or several separate areas that are near each other.  In 2005, these areas were designated as common resource areas (CRAs) within the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  CRAs are created by subdividing MLRAs by topography, other landscape features, hydrologic units, resource concerns, resource uses, and human considerations affecting use and soil and water conservation treatment needs.  Common resource areas, or land resource units, are not described in this handbook and are not shown on the national map.  Major land resource areas are geographically associated land resource units.  Land resource regions are a group of geographically associated major land resource areas. Identification of these large areas is important in statewide agricultural planning and has value in interstate, regional, and national planning.  In order to make this handbook more useful to other Federal agencies and private parties using ecological regions for planning or evaluation of natural resources programs and policies, Appendix I (Agriculture Handbook 296, 2006) cross-references MLRAs with Environmental Protection Agency Level III Ecoregions (USEPA, 2003; Omernik, 1987) and U.S. Forest Service ecological sections (Cleland and others, 2005; McNab and others, 2005).  In this handbook, major land resource areas are generally designated by Arabic numbers and identified by a descriptive geographic name.  Examples are MLRA 1 (Northern Pacific Coast Range, Foothills, and Valleys); MLRA 154 (South-Central Florida Ridge); and MLRA 230 (Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands).  Some MLRAs are designated by an Arabic number and a letter because previously established MLRAs have been divided into smaller, more homogeneous areas, for example, MLRAs 102A, 102B, and 102C.  The use of numbers and letters to identify the newly created MLRAs requires fewer changes in existing information in records and in databases.  A few MLRAs consist of two or more parts separated for short distances by other land resource areas.  In places one of these parts is widely separated from the main body of the MLRA and is in an adjoining LRR.  The description of the respective MLRA also applies to these outlying parts.",Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA),"[{""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""downloadURL"": ""http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov"", ""description"": ""Provides a service for ordering geospatial datasets of MLRA areas."", ""mediaType"": ""text/html"", ""title"": ""Major Land Resource Area Maps""}]",https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,"[""005:53""]",2015-05-24,"{""@type"": ""org:Organization"", ""name"": ""NRCS""}","[""CRA"", ""Common Resource Area"", ""LRR"", ""LRU"", ""Land Resource Region"", ""Land Resource Unit"", ""MLRA"", ""Major Land Resource Area"", ""NGDA"", ""NGDA Portfolio Theme"", ""National Geospatial Data Asset"", ""Soils Theme"", ""soils""]"

The raster and vector map data are also available in a Conterminous US-wide extent.  The raster map data are in 10-, 30-, and 90- meter cell sizes.  The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format in an Albers Equal Area projection.

Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes and additional derived data.

Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types.

The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico.

Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded.

This metric provides a level of detail related to defining the growing season potential. Here, we evaluate the accumulation of growing degree days at or above 5 °C (41 °F), assuming that limited growth occurs below 5 °C. Specifically, we calculate growing degree days by first calculating the average daily temperature, based on the maximum and minimum projected daily temperature. We then subtract 5 °C from each mean value and then accumulate the positive difference values for all days within each year. The mean GDD values for the conterminous United States during the baseline period ranged from less than 100 to over 7,000 degree days, increasing from north to south with highest values in the Florida panhandle, southern Texas, southwestern Arizona, and southeastern California. GDD projections throughout the century suggest a ubiquitous increase across the United States with slightly less change in the Northeast and much greater increases throughout the southern United States under the high scenario.</p><p></p><p>Original data and associated metadata can be downloaded from this website: <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2019-0001"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2019-0001</a></p>",Climate Change Pressures Growing Degree Days,"[{""accessURL"": ""https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fsgisx02/rest/services/RDW_Climate/ClimateChangePressures_GrowingDegreeDays/MapServer"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Web Page"", ""mediaType"": ""text/html""}]",https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/fff187d8e89142c2a61c01a491f16d99/license,"[""005:96""]",2019-06-07,"{""name"": ""U.S. Forest Service""}","[""Climatology"", ""CMIP5"", ""gridded meteorological data"", ""temperature indices"", ""climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere"", ""conterminous United States"", ""precipitation"", ""maximum temperature"", ""minimum temperature"", ""drought"", ""Climate change"", ""extreme events"", ""Ecology"", ""Ecosystems"", "" Environment"", ""monthly"", ""environment"", ""Forest  Plant Health"", ""geoscientificInformation"", ""growing degree days"", ""GDD"", ""Open Data""]"

We define heat zones as the number of days with maximum daily temperature &gt;30 °C (86 °F). Because species have unique adaptations and abilities to tolerate a wide variety of conditions, this metric is used merely as an indicator of change in “hot” conditions. The 30 °C value is set primarily for agricultural production and is a general temperature threshold at which photosynthesis can be negatively impacted for C3 plants (e.g., most species including trees), but it certainly also captures temperatures that induce stress in humans as well. In addition, increases in temperature above these thresholds for longer periods, especially when accompanied with prolonged dry conditions, are linked to reduced performance and likely mortality of trees. Each day surpassing the 30 °C threshold was tallied and summed for each year and reported as the mean number of days, per year, over each 30-year period: baseline, early, mid, and late century.</p><p></p><p>Original data and associated metadata can be downloaded from this website: <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2019-0001"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2019-0001</a></p>",Climate Change Pressures Heat Zones,"[{""accessURL"": ""https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fsgisx02/rest/services/RDW_Climate/ClimateChangePressures_HeatZones/MapServer"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Web Page"", ""mediaType"": ""text/html""}]",https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/e66c766dea41482aa9d766ff4a16fb3a/license,"[""005:96""]",2019-06-07,"{""name"": ""U.S. Forest Service""}","[""climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere"", ""Climatology"", ""minimum temperature"", ""maximum temperature"", ""CMIP5"", ""Ecology"", ""Ecosystems"", "" Environment"", ""monthly"", ""geoscientificInformation"", ""temperature indices"", ""drought"", ""Forest  Plant Health"", ""Palmer Drought Severity Index"", ""extreme events"", ""conterminous United States"", ""environment"", ""gridded meteorological data"", ""Climate change"", ""precipitation"", ""Open Data""]"

Specifically, the value used here is the absolute minimum temperature achieved for each year and reported as the 30-year mean. Because they reflect cold tolerance for many plant species, including woody ones, hardiness zones are most likely to reflect plant range limits. The zonal variations caused by warming temperatures in the future will therefore be useful to approximately delineate niche constraints of many plant species and hence their future range potential. Plant hardiness zones and subzones were delineated according to the USDA definitions, which break the geography into zones by 10 °F (5.56 °C) increments from zone 1 (-55 to -45.6 °C) to zone 13 (15.7 to 22 °C) of annual extreme minimum temperature. To define the coldest day per year, daily minimum temperatures were identified within the period July 1 to June 30, with the nominal year assigned to the first 6 months of the 12-month period.</p><p></p><p>Original data and associated metadata can be downloaded from this website: <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2019-0001"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Product/RDS-2019-0001</a></p>",Climate Change Pressures Plant Hardiness Zones,"[{""accessURL"": ""https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fsgisx02/rest/services/RDW_Climate/ClimateChangePressures_PlantHardinessZones/MapServer"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Web Page"", ""mediaType"": ""text/html""}]",https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/774789d29220451883a567ad73b2f0f2/license,"[""005:96""]",2019-06-07,"{""name"": ""U.S. Forest Service""}","[""Climatology"", ""CMIP5"", ""gridded meteorological data"", ""temperature indices"", ""climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere"", ""conterminous United States"", ""precipitation"", ""maximum temperature"", ""minimum temperature"", ""drought"", ""Climate change"", ""extreme events"", ""Ecology"", ""Ecosystems"", "" Environment"", ""monthly"", ""environment"", ""Forest  Plant Health"", ""geoscientificInformation"", ""plant hardiness zones"", ""PHZ"", ""Open Data""]"

Common designs underestimate vertical wind measurements because they lack a correction for transducer shadowing, with no consensus on a suitable correction. We present a subset of data collected during field experiments in 2011 and 2013 featuring two or four CSAT3 sonic anemometers. We introduce a Bayesian analysis to resolve the three-dimensional correction by optimizing differences between anemometers mounted both vertically and horizontally. A grid of 512 points (~ ±5°resolution in wind location) is defined on a sphere around the sonic anemometer, from which the shadow correction for each transducer-pair is derived from a set of 138 unique state variables describing the quadrants and borders. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the Bayesian model proposes new values for each state variable, recalculates the fast-response dataset, summarizes the five-minute wind statistics, and accepts the proposed new values based on the probability that they make measurements from vertical and horizontal anemometers more equivalent. MCMC chains were constructed for three different prior distributions describing the state variables: no shadow correction, the Kaimal correction for transducer shadowing, and double the Kaimal correction, all initialized with 10% uncertainty. This archive includes all data and source code required to create the 3-D posterior correction and to analyze its effect during the 2011 and 2013 field experiments plus a 2016 field validation experiment. There are 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2011 and 2013 field experiments contained within 74,664 files (one file each per five-minute period, replicate anemometer, and separated between wind and temperature) and 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2016 experiment contained within 1883 files (one file each per each five-minute period, each file contains 3 replicate anemometers). R code is provided to estimate the posterior correction from the 2011 and 2013 wind data using Bayesian analysis assuming three prior corrections: a flat prior, the Kaimal correction, and double the Kaimal correction. Matlab code is provided to normalize, thin, and scale the posterior correction into its final form.

Species include: Lucy's warbler, southwestern willow flycatcher, western yellow-billed cuckoo, New Mexican meadow jumping mouse, Hispid cotton rat, long-legged bat, Occult bat, Yuma bat, black-necked gartersnake, western painted turtle, american bullfrog, and northern leopard frog. These species were selected because their distribution is tied to a habitat or feature characteristic important to multiple species. Models of suitable habitat for each species are based on observation data from collection and survey samples taken from 1970 through 2013. MaxEnt related species' presence to climate, biophysical, and vegetation characteristics. We then projected future suitability of habitats by applying these models to future conditions as predicted by three climate models at three times periods, 2030 (2020-2060), 2060 (2050-2070), and 2090 (2080-2100). The climate data used in this study were derived from the: 1) Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and analysis (CCC) using the CGCM3.1 model, 2) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory (GFDL) using the CM2.1 model and, 3) Met office, Hadley Centre (HAD), using the HadCM3 model. The data in this product therefore represent four different time periods for three different models.

Annotation features are represented as stand-alone map text collected relative to the scale of the topographic quadrangle. The FSTopo database was originally populated with Cartographic Feature File (CFF) data which was digitized from either the Primary Base Series (PBS) quadrangles or U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic map series quadrangles.

FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and depletion of timber on the Nation's forest land. Before 1999, all inventories were conducted on a periodic basis. The passage of the 1998 Farm Bill requires FIA to collect data annually on plots within each State. This kind of up-to-date information is essential to frame realistic forest policies and programs. Summary reports for individual States are published but the Forest Service also provides data collected in each inventory to those interested in further analysis. Data is distributed via the FIA DataMart in a standard format. This standard format, referred to as the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) structure, was developed to provide users with as much data as possible in a consistent manner among States. A number of inventories conducted prior to the implementation of the annual inventory are available in the FIADB. However, various data attributes may be empty or the items may have been collected or computed differently. Annual inventories use a common plot design and common data collection procedures nationwide, resulting in greater consistency among FIA work units than earlier inventories.

The maps use state-of-the-art science and are available for every national forest in the contiguous United States with relevant data coverage. Currently, the map sets include variables related to precipitation, air temperature, snow (including snow residence time and April 1 snow water equivalent), and stream flow.</p>

<p>Historical (1975-2005) and future (2071-2090) precipitation and temperature data for the contiguous United States are ensemble mean values across 20 global climate models from the CMIP5 experiment (https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00094.1), downscaled to a 4 km grid. For more information on the downscaling method and to access the data, please see Abatzoglou and Brown, 2012 (https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.2312) and the Northwest Knowledge Network (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/). We used the MACAv2- Metdata monthly dataset; average temperature values were calculated as the mean of monthly minimum and maximum air temperature values (degrees C), averaged over the season of interest (annual, winter, or summer). Absolute change was then calculated between the historical and future time periods.</p>

These datasets have several important differences from the MACAv2-Metdata (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/) products, used in the contiguous U.S. They were developed using different global circulation models and different downscaling methods, and were downscaled to a different scale (771 m instead of 4 km).

This includes performing soil improvement and watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, tree planting, seeding and other cultural treatments necessary to maintain and improve land productivity. Since its creation millions of acres of National Forest System lands (NFS) have been treated and restored to resilient conditions and terrestrial and aquatic habitat improved. Public Law 109-54 of August 2, 2005, Title IV General Provisions, Sec 412 further amended the K-V Act to allow the collection and use of CWKV funds for watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, to prepare timber sales, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, fire community protection activities, and the maintenance of forest roads within the Forest Service region in which the timber sale occurred. Provided that such activities may be performed through the use of contracts, forest product sales, and cooperative agreements. Note that these activities are to be performed by contract and not Forest Service personnel. The Forest Service used this amendment to administratively create two K-V programs within the K-V fund; CWKV (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Sale Area Projects) and CWK2 (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Regional Projects). This layer shows the spatial representation where activities accomplished and funded with CWKV and CWK2 funds and reported through the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database. It is important to note that this layer may not contain all CWKV or CWK2 accomplished activities; the spatial portion of the activity description is not currently enforced by FACTS and at this time some are optionally reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data reporting is enforced by the application and acceptant of reporting both tabular and spatial we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used for this layer in coming years. <a href=""https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_KnutsonVandenberg.xml"" target=""_blank"">Metadata</a></div>",Knustson-Vandenberg (Feature Layer),"[{""accessURL"": ""http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Web page"", ""mediaType"": ""text/html"", ""title"": ""ArcGIS Open Dataset""}, {""accessURL"": ""https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_KnutsonVandenberg_01/MapServer/8"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Esri REST"", ""mediaType"": ""application/json"", ""title"": ""Esri Rest API""}, {""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""downloadURL"": ""http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.geojson"", ""format"": ""GeoJSON"", ""mediaType"": ""application/vnd.geo+json"", ""title"": ""GeoJSON""}, {""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""downloadURL"": ""http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.csv"", ""format"": ""CSV"", ""mediaType"": ""text/csv"", ""title"": ""CSV""}, {""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""downloadURL"": ""http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.kml"", ""format"": ""KML"", ""mediaType"": ""application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"", ""title"": ""KML""}, {""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""downloadURL"": ""http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.zip"", ""format"": ""ZIP"", ""mediaType"": ""application/zip"", ""title"": ""Shapefile""}, {""accessURL"": ""https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/services/EDW/EDW_KnutsonVandenberg_01/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""OGC WMS"", ""mediaType"": ""application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml"", ""title"": ""OGC WMS""}]",https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8/license,"[""005:96""]",2019-05-10,"{""name"": ""U.S. Forest Service""}","[""Knutson Vangenberg Act"", ""Recovery"", ""Activities"", ""Resiliency"", ""Safety"", ""environment"", ""Forest Management"", ""Open Data""]"

to characterize the presumed historical fire regimes within landscapes 
based on interactions between vegetation dynamics, fire spread, fire 
effects, and spatial context. FRG definitions have been altered from 
previous applications to best approximate the definitions outlined in 
the Interagency Fire Regime Condition Class Guidebook. These definitions
 were refined to create discrete, mutually exclusive criteria 
appropriate for use with LANDFIRE's (LF) fire frequency and severity 
data products.
</p>
<p>FRG is created by linking the Biophysical 
Settings (BpS) Group attribute in the BpS layer with the Refresh Model 
Tracker (RMT) data and assigning the FRG attribute. This geospatial 
product should display a reasonable approximation of FRG, as documented 
in the RMT.  (LF 1.0.0 CONUS only used the vegetation and disturbance 
dynamics model LANDSUM)</p>

These plots have not burned since prior to 1939. Treatments were applied to track site changes over time from five short return interval underburn treatments. These treatments, replicated 4 times, were comprised of: biennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season backfires, triennial growing season headfires, growing season headfires every 6 years, and unburned controls. Triennial dormant season treatments were eventually combined. Variables tracked over time include the impact of fire on overstory pine growth, midstory (in this study midstory includes understory plants &gt; 4.5 feet high) structure and composition, seedling (in this study including all woody plants &lt; 4.5 feet high and all other plants regardless of height) species dominance, percent cover, pine seedling establishment and mortality, and forest floor consumption. Several thousand overstory and midstory trees were tagged, GPS coordinates recorded and their survival and growth followed over time. Vegetation was measured in nested circular plots and on line transects. Live and dead overstory trees on two 0.2 acre (1/5 ac) subplots per treatment plot were tallied annually by species with diameter at breast height and height, measured and pest damage/mortality by pathogen, lightning and wind damage recorded. Basal area was calculated periodically. Some overstory pines were bored to determine age (typically after death). Midstory live and dead trees were tallied annually on six 0.02 acre subplots per treatment plot. Seedlings were tallied on eighteen 0.001 acre (MA = milacre) subplots per treatment plot by species/species group, and percent of the subplot area in vines, herbs, moss, live woody material, dead plant material, and void of plant material (exposed mineral soil). Six 33 feet line transects per treatment plot were divided into 6 inch segments and dominant seedling species/species group tallied annually. Over 150 species/species groups were identified and tracked over time. Weights of likely available live fuel were determined by species/species group prior to each burn, as were weights of likely available dead fuel for various categories/size classes. Paired postburn samples were collected to determine consumption of various fuel categories. Overstory and midstory pine crown scorch, foliage consumption, and hardwood mortality were tallied within two weeks following each burn. Other vegetation datasets include pine seedling establishment and survival over time on the 18 MA subplots per treatment plot. Red cockaded woodpecker (RCW) related information was collected annually by Region 8 (Southern Region) of the USFS and is available from them. Live and dead fuel moisture data were sampled prior to every burn and can include preburn moisture content grab samples, 10-hour fuel stick readings, and random lumber probe readings. Fire behavior records of headfires and backfires can include rate of spread, flame length, flame angle, flame zone depth, short distance spotting, slopovers, burnout time, and percent of plot burned. The study plan called for observations of fire residence time as well, but such observations were rarely recorded. Weather data include on-plot hand-held instrument observations of surface wind velocity, ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). On-site data collected can include precipitation, ambient temperature, RH and wind traces from recording gauges.

Forested and mountainous locations, such as national forests, tend to receive more precipitation than adjacent non-forested or low-lying areas. However, contributions of national forest lands to regional streamflow volumes is largely unknown. Using outputs from the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model, we calculated mean annual and mean summer (July and August) streamflow metrics based on total flow and flow from national forest lands for each 1:100,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset stream reach in the contiguous United States. Specifically, this data publication contains twenty-one comma-delimited ASCII text files (for different drainage areas and processing units across the United States) containing 1915-2011 mean annual flow and mean summer flow. These files also contain the mean annual and mean summer flows from National forest system (NFS) lands as well as the portion of total mean annual flow contributed by flow from NFS lands. These data provide insight into 1915-2011 hydrologic regimes and national forest contributions to total water yield and can be joined to a National Hydrography Dataset stream layer for spatial illustrations and studies.",Modeled historical streamflow metrics for the contiguous United States and National Forest Lands,"[{""accessURL"": ""https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2017-0046"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Web Page"", ""mediaType"": ""text/html""}]",https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/59f82a76626a46789a8f2b7b31f9c04d/license,"[""005:96""]",2019-03-08,"{""name"": ""U.S. Forest Service""}","[""streamflow"", ""National Forest"", ""water supply"", ""water yield"", ""variable infiltration capacity VIC"", ""climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere"", ""inlandWaters"", ""environment"", ""Ecology"", ""Ecosystems"", "" Environment"", ""Hydrology"", ""watersheds"", ""sedimentation"", ""Natural Resource Management  Use"", ""Water"", ""United States"", ""National Forests"", ""Open Data"", ""RDA""]"

The ecological effects of wildland fire – also termed the fire severity – are often highly heterogeneous in space and time. This heterogeneity is a result of spatial variability in factors such as fuel, topography, and climate (e.g. mean annual temperature). However, temporally variable factors such as daily weather and climatic extremes (e.g. an unusually warm year) also may play a key role. Scientists from the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station and the University of Montana conducted a study in which observed data were used to produce statistical models describing the probability of high severity fire as a function of fuel, topography, climate, and fire weather. Observed data from over 2000 fires (from 2002-2015) were used to build individual models for each of 19 ecoregions in the contiguous US (see Parks et al. 2018, Figure 1). High severity fire was measured using a fire severity metric termed the relativized burn ratio, which uses pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery to measure fire-induced ecological change. Fuel included pre-fire metrics of live fuel amount such as NDVI. Topography included factors such as slope and potential solar radiation. Climate summarized 30-year averages of factors such as mean summer temperature that spatially vary across the study area. Lastly, fire weather incorporated temporally variable factors such as daily and annual temperature. In turn, these statistical models were used to generate 'wall-to-wall' maps depicting the probability of high severity fire, if a fire were to occur, for 13 of the 19 ecoregions. Maps were not produced for ecoregions in which model quality was deemed inadequate. All maps use fuel data representing the year 2016 and therefore provide a fairly up-to-date assessment of the potential for high severity fire. For those ecoregions in which the relative influence of fire weather was fairly strong (n=6), two additional maps were produced, one depicting the probability of high severity fire under moderate weather and the other under extreme weather. An important consideration is that only pixels defined as forest were used to build the models; consequently maps exclude pixels considered non-forest.",Next Generation Fire Severity Mapping (Image Service),"[{""accessURL"": ""http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/870b0a1777d5455faab124e7db96824b"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Web page"", ""mediaType"": ""text/html"", ""title"": ""ArcGIS Open Dataset""}, {""accessURL"": ""https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fsgisx01/rest/services/RDW_Wildfire/RMRS_NextGenerationFireSeverityMapping/ImageServer"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""Esri REST"", ""mediaType"": ""application/json"", ""title"": ""Esri Rest API""}, {""accessURL"": ""https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fsgisx01/services/RDW_Wildfire/RMRS_NextGenerationFireSeverityMapping/ImageServer"", ""@type"": ""dcat:Distribution"", ""format"": ""OGC WMS"", ""mediaType"": ""application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml"", ""title"": ""OGC WMS""}]",https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/870b0a1777d5455faab124e7db96824b/license,"[""005:96""]",2019-03-26,"{""name"": ""U.S. Forest Service""}","[""RMRS"", ""Fire"", ""JFSP"", ""fire effects"", ""fire severity"", ""fire ecology"", ""wildland fire"", ""joint fire science program"", ""burn severity"", ""environment"", ""Open Data""]"

<p>Historical (1975-2005) and future (2071-2090) precipitation and temperature data for the state of Alaska were developed by the Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning (SNAP) (https://snap.uaf.edu). Monthly precipitation values (mm) were summed over the season of interest (annual, winter, or summer). These datasets have several important differences from the MACAv2-Metdata (https://climate.northwestknowledge.net/MACA/) products, used in the contiguous U.S. They were developed using different global circulation models and different downscaling methods, and were downscaled to a different scale (771 m instead of 4 km). While these cover the same time periods and use broadly similar approaches, caution should be used when directly comparing values between Alaska and the contiguous United States.</p>

The IRA data was originally submitted to the Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC - Located in Salt Lake City Utah) by all national forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service?s Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency.

Sample sites are spaced at a 1 kilometer interval throughout the historical range of bull trout. eDNA stream samples are collected and species presence/absence is determined by analyses at the National Genomics Center. Results are recorded in the feature attribute table of the eDNA sample site shapefile. One point feature in the shapefile was generated for each 1 kilometer sample point in the bull trout eDNA feature class. Where multiple samples were collected at a single eDNA sample site, replicate point features will occur at a single location in the shapefile. The bull trout is an ESA-listed species with a historical range that encompasses many waters across the Northwest. Though once abundant, bull trout have declined in many locations and are at risk from a changing climate, nonnative species, and habitat degradation. Informed conservation planning relies on sound and precise information about the distribution of bull trout in thousands of streams, but gathering this information is a daunting and expensive task. To overcome this problem, we coupled 1) predictions from the range-wide, spatially precise Climate Shield model on the location of natal habitats of bull trout with 2) a sampling template for every 8-digit hydrologic unit in the historical range of bull trout, based on the probability of detecting bull trout presence using environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling (McKelvey et al. 2016). The template consists of a master set of geospatially referenced sampling locations at 1-kilometer intervals within each cold-water habitat. We also identified sampling locations at this same interval based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) designation of critical spawning and rearing habitat. Based on field tests of eDNA detection probabilities conducted by the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation, this sampling approach will reliably determine the presence of populations of bull trout, as well as provide insights on non-spawning habitats used by adult and subadult fish. The completed bull trout eDNA survey results are available through an interactive ArcGIS Online Map.

resources select the shapefile or geodatabase option.<div>America's private forests provide a vast array of public goods and services, including abundant, clean surface water. Forest loss and development can affect water quality and quantity when forests are removed and impervious surfaces, such as paved roads, spread across the landscape. We rank watersheds across the conterminous United States according to the contributions of private forest land to surface drinking water and by threats to surface water from increased housing density. Private forest land contributions to drinking water are greatest in the East but are also important in Western watersheds. Development pressures on these contributions are concentrated in the Eastern United States but are also found in the North-Central region, parts of the West and Southwest, and the Pacific Northwest; nationwide, more than 55 million acres of rural private forest land are projected to experience a substantial increase in housing density from 2000 to 2030. Planners, communities, and private landowners can use a range of strategies to maintain freshwater ecosystems, including designing housing and roads to minimize impacts on water quality, managing home sites to protect water resources, and using payment schemes and management partnerships to invest in forest stewardship on public and private lands.This data is based on the digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the continental United States. To focus this analysis on watersheds with private forests, only watersheds with at least 10% forested land and more than 50 acres of private forest were analyzed. All other watersheds were labeled ?Insufficient private forest for this analysis'and coded -99999 in the data table.

Royce and published as the second part of the two-part Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1896-1897 have been scanned, georeferenced in JPEG2000 format, and digitized to create this feature class of cession maps. The mapped cessions and reservations included in the 67 maps correspond to entries in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions, “indicating the number and location of each cession by or reservation for the Indian tribes from the organization of the Federal Government to and including 1894, together with descriptions of the tracts so ceded or reserved, the date of the treaty, law or executive order governing the same, the name of the tribe or tribes affected thereby, and historical data and references bearing thereon,” as set forth in the subtitle of the Schedule. Go to this URL for full metadata: http://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.TRIBALCEDEDLANDS.xml Each Royce map was georeferenced against one or more of the following USGS 1:2,000,000 National Atlas Feature Classes contained in \NatlAtlas_USGS.gdb: cities_2mm, hydro_ln_2mm, hydro_pl_2mm, plss_2mm, states_2mm. Cessions were digitized as a file geodatabase (GDB) polygon feature class, projected as NAD83 USA_Contiguous_Lambert_Conformal_Conic, which is the same projection used to georeference the maps. The feature class was later reprojected to WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere) to optimize it for the Tribal Connections Map Viewer. Polygon boundaries were digitized as to not deviate from the drawn polygon edge to the extent that space could be seen between the digitized polygon and the mapped polygon at a viewable scale. Topology was maintained between coincident edges of adjacent polygons. The cession map number assigned by Royce was entered into the feature class as a field attribute. The Map Cession ID serves as the link referencing relationship classes and joining additional attribute information to 752 polygon features, to include the following: 1. Data transcribed from Royce’s Schedule of Indian Land Cessions: a. Date(s), in the case of treaties, the date the treaty was signed, not the date of the proclamation; b. Tribe(s), the tribal name(s) used in the treaty and/or the Schedule; and c. Map Name(s), the name of the map(s) on which a cession number appears; 2. URLs for the corresponding entry in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions (Internet Archive) for each unique combination of a Date and reference to a Map Cession ID (historical references in the Schedule are included); 3. URLs for the corresponding treaty text, including the treaties catalogued by Charles J. Kappler in Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties (HathiTrust Digital Library), executive order or other federal statute (Library of Congress and University of Georgia) identified in each entry with a reference to a Map Cession ID or IDs; 4. URLs for the image of the Royce map(s) (Library of Congress) on which a given cession number appears; 5. The name(s) of the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text, as well as the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes; and 6. The present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. During the 2017-2018 revision of the attribute data, it was noted that 7 of the Cession Map IDs are missing spatial representation in the Feature Class. The missing data is associated with the following Cession Map IDs: 47 (Illinois 1), 65 (Tennessee and Bordering States), 128 (Georgia), 129 (Georgia), 130 (Georgia), 543 (Indian Territory 3), and 690 (Iowa 2), which will be updated in the future. This dataset revises and expands the dataset published in 2015 by the U.S. Forest Service and made available through the Tribal Connections viewer, the Forest Service Geodata Clearinghouse, and Data.gov. The 2018 dataset is a result of collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Office of Tribal Relations (OTR); the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National NAGPRA Program; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of International and Tribal Affairs, American Indian Environmental Office; and Dr. Claudio Saunt of the University of Georgia. The Forest Service and Dr. Saunt independently digitized and georeferenced the Royce cession maps and developed online map viewers to display Native American land cessions and reservations. Dr. Saunt subsequently undertook additional research to link Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statutes and executive orders to cession and reservation polygons, which he agreed to share with the U.S. Forest Service. OTR revised the data, linking the Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statues and executive orders to all 1,172 entries in the attribute table. The 2018 dataset has incorporated data made available by the National NAGPRA Program, specifically the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text and the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes, as well as the present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. This data replaces in its entirety the National NAGPRA data included in the dataset published in 2015. The 2015 dataset incorporated data presented in state tables compiled from the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions by the National NAGPRA Program. In recent years the National NAGPRA Program has been working to ensure the accuracy of this data, including the reevaluation of the present-day Indian tribes and the provision of references for their determinations. Changes made by the OTR have not been reviewed or approved by the National NAGPRA Program. The Forest Service will continue to collaborate with other federal agencies and work to improve the accuracy of the data included in this dataset. Errors identified since the dataset was published in 2015 have been corrected, and we request that you notify us of any additional errors we may have missed or that have been introduced.
