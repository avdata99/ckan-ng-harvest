TIMSS 2015 (https://nces.ed.gov/timss/) is a cross-sectional study that provides international comparative information of the mathematics and science literacy of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students and examines factors that may be associated with the acquisition of math and science literacy in students. The study was conducted using direct assessments of students and questionnaires for students, teachers, and school administrators. Fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-graders in the 2014\u201315 school year were sampled. Key statistics produced from TIMSS 2015 provide reliable and timely data on the mathematics and science achievement of U.S. students compared to that of students in other countries. Data are expected to be released in 2018.",

This 2001 Sexual Harassment Guidance reaffirms the compliance standards that OCR applies in investigations and administrative enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 regarding sexual harassment. The guidance provides the principles that a school should use to recognize and effectively respond to sexual harassment of students in its program as a condition of receiving Federal financial assistance. This 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence explains that the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 cover sexual violence and reminds schools of their responsibilities to take immediate and effective steps to respond to sexual violence in accordance with the requirements of Title IX. This 2013 Dear Colleague Letter on Retaliation reminds school districts, postsecondary institutions, and other recipients that retaliation is also a violation of Federal law. The letter seeks to clarify the basic principles of retaliation law and to describe OCR\ufffds methods of enforcement.",

The purpose of Promise Neighborhoods is to improve significantly the educational and developmental outcomes of children in our most distressed communities, and to transform those communities by-- (1) Supporting efforts to improve child outcomes and ensure that data on those outcomes are communicated and analyzed on an ongoing basis by leaders and members of the community; (2) Identifying and increasing the capacity of eligible entities that are focused on achieving results and building a college-going culture in the neighborhood; (3) Building a complete continuum of cradle-through-college-to-career solutions (continuum of solutions), which has both academic programs and family and community supports, with a strong school or schools at the center. Academic programs must include (a) High-quality early learning programs designed to improve outcomes in multiple domains of early learning; (b) programs, policies, and personnel for children in kindergarten through the 12th grade that are linked to improved academic outcomes; and (c) programs that prepare students for college and career success. Family and community supports must include programs to improve student health, safety, community stability, family and community engagement, and student access to 21st century learning tools. The continuum of solutions also must be linked and integrated seamlessly so there are common outcomes, a focus on similar milestones, support during transitional time periods, and no time or resource gaps that create obstacles for students in making academic progress. The continuum also must be based on the best available evidence including, where available, strong or moderate evidence, and include programs, policies, practices, services, systems, and supports that result in improving educational and developmental outcomes for children from cradle through college to career; (4) Integrating programs and breaking down agency \"silos\" so that solutions are implemented effectively and efficiently across agencies; (5) Supporting the efforts of eligible entities, working with local governments, to build the infrastructure of policies, practices, systems, and resources needed to sustain and \"scale up\" proven, effective solutions across the broader region beyond the initial neighborhood; and (6) Learning about the overall impact of Promise Neighborhoods and about the relationship between particular strategies in Promise Neighborhoods and student outcomes, including a rigorous evaluation of the program.",

They also provide financial breakdowns of expenditures by vocational rehabilitation agencies as well as information on referrals sources, services provided to individuals, counselor caseloads and eligibility rates. Tables cover consumer information and information on VR agency expenditures. While several programs exist to assist individuals with disabilities to become employed, the primary one overseen by the Department of Education is the vocational rehabilitation (VR) program. Under Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Act), states receive federal grants to operate a comprehensive VR program. These funds are awarded to designated state VR agencies within each state. This state-operated program is designed to assess, plan, develop and provide VR services to eligible individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests and informed choice. By providing services in this way, the VR program enables individuals with disabilities to prepare for and engage in employment.  For data after 2005, see rsa.ed.gov.",

The MBK Task Force coordinates a Federal effort to improve significantly the expected life outcomes for boys and young men of color and their contributions to U.S. prosperity. The MBK Task Force collaborated with the Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics and federal statistical agencies to pull together new statistics for key indicators - derived from existing, publicly available datasets - cross tabulated for race and gender for the first time. These statistics are highlighted in the MBK Task Force May 2014 report and are posted on MBK.ed.gov.",

States were awarded nearly $3.5 billion in School Improvement Grant funds in 2010 to turn around their persistently lowest achieving schools. School districts then applied to state for the funds this spring. When school districts applied, they were required to indicate that they would implement one of the following four models in their persistently lowest achieving schools: Turnaround Model: Replace the principal, screen existing school staff, and rehire no more than half the teachers; adopt a new governance structure; and improve the school through curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and other strategies. Restart Model: Convert a school or close it and re-open it as a charter school or under an education management organization. School Closure: Close the school and send the students to higher-achieving schools in the district. Transformation Model: Replace the principal and improve the school through comprehensive curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and other strategies.",

      "description": "Thank you for your interest in the Ready to Learn Television program! Ready to Learn Television supports the development of educational television and digital media targeted at preschool and early elementary school children and their families. Its general goal is to promote early learning and school readiness, with a particular interest in reaching low-income children. In addition to creating television and other media products, the program supports activities intended to promote national distribution of the programming, effective educational uses of the programming, community-based outreach, and research on educational effectiveness. You can use the tools below to look at general information about the grant applications that were submitted in June 2010. There were a total of 38 eligible applications, of which three were selected for funding. In this 2010 competition, applicants were invited to submit proposals for the development of innovative transmedia programming - that is, the use of television and other media such as the internet, mobile devices, and print in interconnected ways. In the 2010 grant competition, there was a two-tier review process in which the applications that scored the highest against the program's general review criteria were advanced to a second tier in which their responses to the competitive preference priority on research were scored. In the data summaries below, applicants that advanced to tier two are denoted as \"highly rated applicants,\" and those that received awards are listed as \"grantees\". The data presented here is sourced from the applications submitted to the program. The data may not be a full representation of the information provided in the formal application. Inclusion of an application in this summary information is not an endorsement of an organization, idea, program, or product, and the Department does not validate or guarantee the accuracy of this information. The data are provided in this summary solely for the convenience of the public. For more information about the Ready to Learn program, go to https://www2.ed.gov/programs/rtltv/index.html.",

The U.S. Department of Education conducts reviews to evaluate an institution's compliance with the Clery Act requirements. A review may be initiated when a complaint is received, a media event raises certain concerns, the school's independent audit identifies serious noncompliance, or through a review selection process that may also coincide with state reviews performed by the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Service (CJIS) Audit Unit. Once a review is completed, the Department issues a Final Program Review Determination. Although regular program reviews may contain Clery Act findings, this page includes only those program reviews that were focused exclusively on the Clery Act.",

TSFG <https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/projects/evaluation/tq_teacherprep_early.asp> includes a cross-sectional survey that measures the frequency of particular variations in teachers' preparation experiences. The study examines whether the instructional skills that teachers learn about and have opportunities to practice in their preparation programs are associated with novice teachers' effectiveness in the classroom, as measured by teacher value-added scores. The data collection was conducted using electronic data collection from school districts and online surveys of school districts and elementary and middle school teachers. Teachers in their first, second, or third year of teaching responsible for teaching to at least one general education classroom of fourth- through sixth-grade students were sampled. TSFG will compute value-added scores for teachers, based on students' state math and English language arts tests, and examine the relationships between teacher preparation experiences and teacher value-added scores.",

School districts are single-purpose administrative units designed by state and local officials to organize and provide public education for local residents. District boundaries are collected for NCES by the U.S. Census Bureau to support educational research and program administration, and the boundaries are essential for constructing district-level estimates of the number of children in poverty. The Census Bureau\u2019s School District Boundary Review program (SDBR) (</span></span><a href='https://www.census.gov/geo/partnerships/sdrp.html'><span><span>https://www.census.gov/geo/partnerships/sdrp.html</span></span></a><span><span>) obtains the boundaries, names, and grade ranges from state officials, and integrates these updates into Census TIGER/Line. Although the Census Bureau updates TIGER/Line every year, the SDBR is a biennial update conducted on the odd-numbered years, therefore district boundaries for a given school year persist in TIGER for two years (e.g., boundaries for the 2015-2016 school year are included in TIGER/Line 2016 and 2017). Census TIGER boundaries include legal maritime buffers for coastal areas by default, but the NCES composite file removes these buffers to facilitate broader use and cleaner cartographic representation. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop the composite school district files. The inputs for this data layer were developed from Census TIGER/Line 2017 and represent boundaries reported for the 2015-2016 school year.

The CCD program annually collects administrative and fiscal data about all public schools, school districts, and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include basic directory and contact information for schools and school districts, as well as characteristics about student demographics, number of teachers, school grade span, and various other administrative conditions. The CCD program also provides fiscal data about school district revenues and expenditures. CCD school and agency point locations are derived from reported information about the physical location of schools and agency administrative offices. The NCES EDGE program collaborates with the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Education Demographic, Geographic, and Economic Statistics (EDGE) Branch to develop point locations for local education agency (LEA) administrative offices reported in the annual CCD directory file. The point locations in this data layer were developed from the 2016-2017 CCD collection.

The ACS is a continuous household survey that collects social, demographic, economic, and housing information from the population in the United States each month. The Census Bureau calculates the income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) based on money income reported for families relative to the poverty thresholds, which are determined based on the family size and structure. Noncash benefits (such as food stamps and housing subsidies) are excluded, as are capital gains and losses. The IPR is the percentage of family income that is above or below the federal poverty level. The IPR indicator ranges from 0 to a top-coded value of 999. A family with income at the poverty threshold has an IPR value of 100. The estimates in this file reflect the IPR for the neighborhoods around schools which may be different from the neighborhood conditions of students enrolled in schools.",

Attendance boundaries, sometimes known as school catchment areas, define the geographic extent served by a local school for the purpose of student assignments. School district administrators create attendance areas to help organize and plan district-wide services, and districts may adjust individual school boundaries to help balance the physical capacity of local schools with changes in the local school-age population. The SABS collection includes boundaries for more than 70,000 schools in over 12,000 school districts throughout the U.S.</span></span></p><p></div></div></div></p>",
